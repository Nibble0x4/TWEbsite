	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Saturn, Lord of Time </b>
	<br>
	<br><br> Saturn is the lord of time. What exactly that entails is a scary and difficult subject for most of the world. Even in Enthan, the people are not sure whether to revere or fear Saturn.
Saturn is not the Primary God of Enthan, where his shrine resides, but he is often considered to be the most powerful. He is reserved, cloistering his followers in his shrine compound far to the north.
The goals of Saturn are unknown. All that is known is that history is kept there. Some say he knows the future as well, others say he writes it, but Saturn is not keen on clearing up these rumors.
In the end, History is his. The rest of the world just hopes he knows what to do with it.
	

	 
	
	<hr>

	<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="header"> Status</b>
			<br><br> Saturn is currently enshrined as the Fringe God of Enthan.
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Personality</b>
	<br> Saturn is old, if that is even possible for him. He acts old, staying out of the affairs of the other deities of TWE. He is powerful, respected, and there are few who see value in provoking him.
Despite the effect his presence has on others, Saturn is a quiet and reserved lord. He speaks rarely, only to give warning or advice, and is otherwise content to watch and record.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Creed </b>
	<br> To remain patient at all times. To never rush, unless needed, and to never need to rush. To never forget what came before, to record what is here and to consider what will come next. To not cling desperately to life. To prepare for the inevitable event of your passing. To act with the future and the past ever in mind. To play the long game, knowing your god will outlast everything. To one who loses the proper perspective, be warned. Your time is running out.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Becoming a Follower </b>
	<br> The path to becoming a true follower of a deity is a journey in and of itself. Doing so requires journeying to the deity's shrine and performing acts of devotion that endear you to them. 
	<br><br>When you have proven yourself and gained their favor, you may choose to subject yourself to their Creed and become their follower. Doing so grants you Divine Blessings and a Divine Power. As you continue to follow them faithfully, always living by the Creed, your deity level increases (this level is separate from your character and class levels) and new Divine Powers are attained.
	<br><br> However, if you break the Creed, you will suffer Divine Judgment from your deity until you atone. Be very careful.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shrine Location</b>
			<br><br> Saturn's shrine is located along the cliffs of northwestern Enthan, north of Thyllia.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Acts of Devotion</b>
			<br><br> The ancient god of time enjoys it when mortals spend time wisely, learning what came before and taking instruction from it.
			<br> For those who seek his favor, avoid wasting time, always making the best use of what you have.
			<br> Catching Saturn's attention is simply a matter of mimicking him. Be patient, long-suffering, slow to anger, and to play the long game.
			<br> Sacrifice to Saturn comes in the form of giving Saturn some of your time back.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Blessings</b>
			<br><br> These blessings are gained by every new official follower upon their acceptance by the god and their sworn adherence to the Creed.
			<ol>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to Constitution or Wisdom, your choice. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to any ability score. </li>
				<li>Gain a +2 Divine Bonus to Knowledge(History) checks. </li>
				<li>Whenever you are affected by a magical effect that lasts for a duration, you may choose to cut the duration in half or double it. </li>
				<li>Gain access to the Touch of Fatigue cantrip as a spell-like ability. If you can already cast this, then it is modified such that when it is used on a fatigued target the target becomes exhausted.</li>
				<li>Gain Knowledge(History) as a class skill. If it is already a class skill, instead gain a +3 Divine Bonus to it.</li>
			</ol>

		
		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Powers</b>
			<br><br>As you continue to grow as a follower of Saturn, you will gain access to new powers. Here is a list of powers that have been discovered by previous followers of Saturn in TWE:
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 1 - ????</b>
			<br> There has yet to be a player who played a follower of Saturn in TWE.
		</div>

		
		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Judgment</b>
			<br><br> These are the dangers that await you if you fail to uphold the Creed of Saturn or otherwise fall into his judgment.
			<ol>
				<li>You immediately lose all Saturn Divine Powers and Saturn FP. Your Divine Blessings are inverted from bonuses into penalties. </li>
				<li>You cannot benefit from any effects that quicken you, including Haste. These effects are instead reversed and turned into Slowness type effects. </li>
				<li>You cannot benefit from time spells, and any you cast are twisted. </li>
				<li>You find that your time is rapidly slipping away... </li>
			</ol>


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Clerics of Saturn </b>
	<br> It is not necessary to be a Cleric to follow Saturn. However, if you wish to begin play as a Cleric who worships the god of the heavens, then you may choose to live by his creed and begin as a follower of Saturn. Doing so will grant you all the benefits of Saturn Level 1. Here is some information specific for clerics of Saturn.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Available Domains</b>
			<br>Any cleric of Saturn must have at least one of these domains. Any domain spells or powers from these domains used by the cleric gains +1 Caster Level.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Favored Weapon</b>
			<br><br> Saturn favors the <a target="blank" href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html#1H-Martial"><b>Sword Cane</b></a>, a danger concealed in a symbol of age.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Channeling Effect </b>
			<br><br> Whenever a cleric (or paladin) channels the power of Saturn, it comes with an additional effect depending on whether the channel is being used to heal or to harm. These effects often incorporate X, where <b>X is the cleric's Saturn level</b>:
			<br><b><u>Healing - </u></b> Each affected creature may take +1 or -1 action on their turn this turn. If they do, they take the other one next turn.
			<br><b><u>Harming - </u></b> Each affected creature that fails its save is Slowed for one round. Creatures cannot be Slowed by this effect on consecutive rounds.
