	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Tu-Shen, Earth Mother </b>
	<br>
	<br><br>  Tu-Shen is the goddess of the earth, the solid, immovable, endlessly caring mother that raises up and provides for all living things. She is the foundation upon which all is built, the sustainer of all.
	<br>Without her, life as it is would be impossible. Without her dependability and resolution, all plans would be in vain. Despite this, Tu-Shen is a humble goddess. She rarely speaks, preferring instead to keep to her silent, incessant work. She works to provide return on the work of others, helping plants to grow and guiding streams of water through her domain. Every detail is deliberate, her care painstaking and her patience eternal.
	<br>Tu-Shen's First Aspect is feminine, meaning she is often referred to as a goddess.
	<br>The First Aspect of Tu-Shen, commonly referred to as Tu, provides support and strength to anyone with the dedication to work her soil. She delights in their effort, showering them with abundance in equal measure to their struggles.
	<br>The Second Aspect of Tu-Shen, often called Shen, is even more quiet and reserved than Tu. He holds the firmament in place and reminds all to respect the earth. The soil is soft and pleasant, but it is heavy.
	<br>Shen warns quietly, reminding anyone who would take advantage of the earth just how small they truly are and just how dangerous even a single pebble can truly be.
	

	 
	
	<hr>

	<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="header"> Status</b>
			<br><br> Tu-Shen is currently enshrined as the Secondary Goddess of Areth.
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Personality</b>
	<br>  Tu is soft, warm, and caring. She listens to the pleas of her followers and responds, urging them to try their hardest and rewarding them ten-fold when they rise to the occasion.
	<br>She loves to attend to the needs of her children, but she loves even more to see them grow. Any opportunity to learn, to struggle, to persevere is sacred to her. However, when her little ones are truly endangered, she will not idly sit by.
	<br>Shen is cold, harsh, and impossible to shake. He does not invite followers, and the number who follow him is small when compared to his feminine side. However, for those who pursue him, he will never turn anyone away. Instead, he provides an example of reslilience, duty, and determination that inspires respect and self-improvement.
	<br>If someone manages to get Shen's attention, it is rarely for a good reason. Those people have much to fear. One wrong step, one slip-up, and the earth will reclaim them.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Creed </b>
	<br> To stand strong, firm, and ever-ready for growth. To seek always to work hard, striving to make something from nothing and much from little. To cultivate, grow, build, and strive to attain more.
	<br>To do much with little, both in speech and action. To let strength be felt and to provide safety and support for others who need it. To hold all within your reach, keeping it as it should be.
	<br>To mind yourself, ever aware of your strengths and your limitations. Always grow, push back your limitations, and to become more than you were.
	<br>Fail to do this, become complacent, and your return will be sour. Know that your goddess expects much of you, and that she always repays.

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Becoming a Follower </b>
	<br> The path to becoming a true follower of a deity is a journey in and of itself. Doing so requires journeying to the deity's shrine and performing acts of devotion that endear you to them. 
	<br><br>When you have proven yourself and gained their favor, you may choose to subject yourself to their Creed and become their follower. Doing so grants you Divine Blessings and a Divine Power. As you continue to follow them faithfully, always living by the Creed, your deity level increases (this level is separate from your character and class levels) and new Divine Powers are attained.
	<br><br> However, if you break the Creed, you will suffer Divine Judgment from your deity until you atone. Be very careful.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shrine Location</b>
			<br><br> Tu-Shen's shrine is located in Plota, Areth.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Acts of Devotion</b>
			<br><br> Tu-Shen wants her followers to be careful, mindful, and hard-working.
			<br> To catch her attention, work the land. Do so quietly, humbly, and consistently.
			<br> The more your shoulder and the less you complain, the greater your odds of winning Tu-Shen's favor.
			<br> Finally, mark your attitude. Pay respect to those who work hard, never seeking an unfair edge.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Blessings</b>
			<br><br> These blessings are gained by every new official follower upon their acceptance by the god and their sworn adherence to the Creed.
			<br> Followers of Tu-Shen must choose whether to revere the <b>Masculine</b> or <b>Feminine</b> aspect primarily. This changes the Blessings they receive.
			<ol>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to Constitution or Wisdom, your choice. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to any ability score. </li>
				<li>Gain a Profession as a class skill with 1 rank in it.</li>
				<li>Gain a +4 Divine Bonus on a Profession skill of your choice. </li>
				<li>If you revere the <b>Feminine</b> Aspect of Tu-Shen, gain access to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/soften-earth-and-stone/">Soften Earth and Stone</a> as a spell-like ability. You may cast it in this way a number of times per day equal to your Tu-Shen level. </li>
				<li>If you revere the <b>Masculine</b> Aspect of Tu-Shen, gain access to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/binding-earth/">Bind Earth</a> as a spell-like ability. You may cast it in this way a number of times per day equal to your Tu-Shen level. </li>
			</ol>

		
		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Powers</b>
			<br><br>As you continue to grow as a follower of Tu-Shen, you will gain access to new powers. Here is a list of powers that have been discovered by previous followers of Tu-Shen in TWE.
			<br> <b> If you revere one aspect more than the other, you may only wield the powers that align with your revered aspect. Doing so grants you a -1 reduction to the FP costs of any Divine Powers aligned with that aspect (minimum 1).</b>
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 1 - ????</b>
			<br> There has yet to be a player who played a follower of Tu-Shen in TWE.
		</div>

		
		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Judgment</b>
			<br><br> These are the dangers that await you if you fail to uphold the Creed of Tu-Shen or otherwise fall into her judgment.
			<ol>
				<li>You immediately lose all Tu-Shen Divine Powers and Tu-Shen FP. Your Divine Blessings are inverted from bonuses into penalties. </li>
				<li>All natural grounded terrains are treated as difficult terrain.</li>
				<li>Watch your step, the earth does not forget...</li>
			</ol>


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Clerics of Tu-Shen </b>
	<br> It is not necessary to be a Cleric to follow Tu-Shen. However, if you wish to begin play as a Cleric who worships the god of the heavens, then you may choose to live by his creed and begin as a follower of Tu-Shen. Doing so will grant you all the benefits of Tu-Shen Level 1. Here is some information specific for clerics of Tu-Shen.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Available Domains</b>
			<br>Any cleric of Tu-Shen must have at least one of these domains. Any domain spells or powers from these domains used by the cleric gains +1 Caster Level.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Favored Weapon</b>
			<br><br> Tu favors the <a target="blank" href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html#Light-Simple"><b>Sickle</b></a>, a tool first and a weapon if needed.
			<br><br> Shen favors the <a target="blank" href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html#2H-Arethian"><b>Otsuchi</b></a>, a blunt and unyielding weapon.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Channeling Effect </b>
			<br><br> Whenever a cleric (or paladin) channels the power of Tu-Shen, it comes with an additional effect depending on whether the channel is being used to heal or to harm. These effects often incorporate X, where <b>X is the cleric's Tu-Shen level</b>:
			<br><b><u>Healing - </u></b> Affected creatures are nurtured by the earth, granting them Fast Healing 2X for 1d3 turns if they are in contact with the natural ground.
			<br><b><u>Harming - </u></b> This channel harms any air-affiliate creatures and constructs even if it otherwise wouldn't. If it already would, then it deals 2X bonus acid damage. The damage of this channel counts as acid damage for the purposes of resistances and weaknesses.
