	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Vulcan, Master of the Forge </b>
	<br>
	<br><br> Vulcan is the great builder, master of flame and the father of crafting. All those who work with their hands work in his domain, and those who pay him homage are wise. He is credited with the building of the Enthan Empire, especially the founding of the glorious capitol city of Great Enthan.
	

	 
	
	<hr>

	<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="header"> Status</b>
			<br><br> Vulcan is currently enshrined as the Primary God of Enthan.
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Personality</b>
	<br> Vulcan is gruff, harsh, but fair. He is measured in all his emotions, but relentless in his pursuits. He works tirelessly to complete his work, and he expects the same of his followers. Devotion to Vulcan is not easy, not by any measure, but it is bound to produce productivity and efficiency. His ambition is restricted to the skill of his hands and the keenness of his mind, so it is fair to say that his ambition is limitless.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Creed </b>
	<br> To do nothing partial. Do not hesitate once you know what you must do. Do not falter. Finish what you start. To stop working is to die. To stop fighting is to stop being the flame. Construction and destruction are the meaning of life. Change is necessary. Work incessantly to build something worth protecting. Fight unyieldingly to break down that which needs rebuilding. Burn brightly and you will accomplish change. Hide and you will be snuffed out.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Becoming a Follower </b>
	<br> The path to becoming a true follower of a deity is a journey in and of itself. Doing so requires journeying to the deity's shrine and performing acts of devotion that endear you to them. 
	<br><br>When you have proven yourself and gained their favor, you may choose to subject yourself to their Creed and become their follower. Doing so grants you Divine Blessings and a Divine Power. As you continue to follow them faithfully, always living by the Creed, your deity level increases (this level is separate from your character and class levels) and new Divine Powers are attained.
	<br><br> However, if you break the Creed, you will suffer Divine Judgment from your deity until you atone. Be very careful.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shrine Location</b>
			<br><br> Vulcan's shrine is located in the capitol city of Great Enthan.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Acts of Devotion</b>
			<br><br> The industrious Master of the Forge seeks devotion through acts of creation, destruction, and reconstruction.
			<br> For those who seek his favor, completing ambitious tasks like those above will endear him to you.
			<br> Catching Vulcan's attention is simply a matter of mimicking him. Hone your craft, create quality goods, and never be afraid to burn something down and start anew when it is rotten.
			<br> Sacrifice to Vulcan comes in the form of being willing to destroy that which means something to you in order to make something better in its place. This can be items, relationships, systems, whatever.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Blessings</b>
			<br><br> These blessings are gained by every new official follower upon their acceptance by the god and their sworn adherence to the Creed.
			<ol>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to Strength or Intelligence, your choice. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to any ability score. </li>
				<li>Gain a +2 Divine Bonus on Craft checks. </li>
				<li>Halve fire damage taken. When struck by a damaging fire attack from a source outside of your control, gain a +X Divine Bonus to attack and damage rolls, including spell damage, and fire spell effects you create gain +1/2X DC (Where X equals your Vulcan Level)</li>
				<li>Gain access to the Produce Flame spell as a spell-like ability that can be used a number of times per day equal to twice your Vulcan level.</li>
				<li>Gain Craft as a class skill. If it already was, then gain a +3 divine bonus to it. </li>
			</ol>

		
		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Powers</b>
			<br><br>As you continue to grow as a follower of Vulcan, you will gain access to new powers. Here is a list of powers that have been discovered by previous followers of Vulcan in TWE:
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 1 - Vulcanic Heat</b>
			<br> You are infused with the flames of Vulcan. You can spend it to burn all in your path.
			<br> 
			<br><b><u>Smoldering - (2 FP) - </u></b> You gain 1d4 per Vulcan level fire damage that you can expend on any attack or fire spell in the next 10 minutes. You can add this damage to a number of attacks or spells equal to your Vulcan level. You must declare the use of this ability before you roll the attack. If the attack misses, the flame is still expended.
			<br><b><u>Raging - (4 FP) - </u></b> Choose one attack or fire spell. That attack gains 4d8 per Vulcan level fire damage. If the attack misses, the flame is reduced by 1d8 but is not fully spent. If the spell affects multiple targets, this bonus damage is halved.
		</div>

		
		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Judgment</b>
			<br><br> These are the dangers that await you if you fail to uphold the Creed of Vulcan or otherwise fall into his judgment.
			<ol>
				<li>You immediately lose all Vulcan Divine Powers and Vulcan FP. Your Divine Blessings are inverted from bonuses into penalties. </li>
				<li>Your forge refuses to light and you gain a weakness to fire. </li>
				<li>Flame is very volatile around you... </li>
			</ol>


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Clerics of Vulcan </b>
	<br> It is not necessary to be a Cleric to follow Vulcan. However, if you wish to begin play as a Cleric who worships the god of the heavens, then you may choose to live by his creed and begin as a follower of Vulcan. Doing so will grant you all the benefits of Vulcan Level 1. Here is some information specific for clerics of Vulcan.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Available Domains</b>
			<br>Any cleric of Vulcan must have at least one of these domains. Any domain spells or powers from these domains used by the cleric gains +1 Caster Level.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Favored Weapon</b>
			<br><br> Vulcan favors the <a target="blank" href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html#1H-Martial"><b>Warhammer</b></a>, a weapon that builds and breaks, but still leaves room to protect.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Channeling Effect </b>
			<br><br> Whenever a cleric (or paladin) channels the power of Vulcan, it comes with an additional effect depending on whether the channel is being used to heal or to harm. These effects often incorporate X, where <b>X is the cleric's Vulcan level</b>:
			<br><b><u>Healing - </u></b> All affected creatures are infused with flame, allowing them to deal X bonus fire damage on their weapon attacks. If they are casting a spell that is flame affiliated, they can add this damage to their spell. If they are casting a damaging spell that is not flame-affiliate, they can change the damage type to fire. In addition, they gain Energy resistance X to fire.
			<br><b><u>Harming - </u></b> The channel harms any water-affiliate creatures and constructs even if it otherwise wouldn't. If it already would, then it deals 2X bonus fire damage. The damage of this channel counts as fire damage for the purposes of resistances and weaknesses.
