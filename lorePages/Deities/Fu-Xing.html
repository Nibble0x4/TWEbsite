	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Fu-Xing, Goddess of Love </b>
	<br>
	<br><br>  Fu-Xing is the deity who presides over passion. She is usually referred to in the feminine sense, as her First Aspect is feminine. Her First Aspect is the goddess of romantic love and carnal desire.
	<br>The First Aspect, often referred to as Fu, is renowned as the goddess of love, lust, attraction, and the irresistable emotion that fills and takes control of the mind and body.
Fu delights in spreading her intoxicating influence throughout TWE, spreading love and excitement in a world full of pain, fear, and loss.
	<br>The Second aspect of Fu-Xing, often referred to as Xing, is her masculine aspect. He is the god of reserved, controlled, sustaining emotion.
Xing presides over friendship, familial bonds, and other powerful but manageable positive feelings. He may not be the master of the all-consuming driving love of the mother for her child, but the strong often unspoken bond of siblings lies within his domain.
	

	 
	
	<hr>

	<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="header"> Status</b>
			<br><br> Fu-Xing is currently enshrined as the People's Goddess of Areth.
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Personality</b>
	<br>  Fu, the First Aspect of Fu-Xing, is an insatiable and outgoing goddess who is sure to get involved in any and all intrigue present between the gods. She is playful, irreverent, and loathe to take anything seriously.
Fu is easy to hear from for those who seek her. She grants her gifts readily and bountifully, often prodding her followers to fulfill tasks that would make any other deity roll their eyes.
	<br>Xing is a far more quiet god. Where Fu is front-and-center, demanding and giving attention, Xing is waiting in the wings. He is a constant warmth opposed to her flaring passion.
Xing makes connections far more slowly and the feelings he cultivates take a long time to come to fruition, often spending entire lifetimes without ever being as strong as those of Fu.
Xing prefers his followers to be less selective about the love that they spread. Instead of bringing the heat of lust, he brings the warmth of companionship.
	<br>Both aspects of Fu-Xing work in tandem to bring happiness and relief to TWE, whether the people want it or not.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Creed </b>
	<br> To love. To love in accordance with the Aspect of your worship, whether doing so as a roaring flame or a smoldering warmth. To always extend your love first, if possible, and to nurture and cultivate the positive feelings of the world. To live hedonistically, seeking pleasure for yourself and all those you meet. To cling to positivity and to wield it as both weapon and armor, facing scowls with a smile until theirs melts into yours. To carry a genuine love within your heart, one that seeks to blossom and spread and blossom again, bringing all those you love together. Carry this love always, lest you be found wanting and dropped like a stone.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Becoming a Follower </b>
	<br> The path to becoming a true follower of a deity is a journey in and of itself. Doing so requires journeying to the deity's shrine and performing acts of devotion that endear you to them. 
	<br><br>When you have proven yourself and gained their favor, you may choose to subject yourself to their Creed and become their follower. Doing so grants you Divine Blessings and a Divine Power. As you continue to follow them faithfully, always living by the Creed, your deity level increases (this level is separate from your character and class levels) and new Divine Powers are attained.
	<br><br> However, if you break the Creed, you will suffer Divine Judgment from your deity until you atone. Be very careful.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shrine Location</b>
			<br><br> Fu-Xing's shrine is located Omeni, Areth.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Acts of Devotion</b>
			<br><br> Fu-Xing appreciates spreading positive feelings wherever you go.
			<br> For those who seek her favor, choose positivity and openness over skepticism.
			<br> Choosing peace and happiness over battle and pain.
			<br> Bringing love to others by whatever means necessary, especially when they don't want it.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Blessings</b>
			<br><br> These blessings are gained by every new official follower upon their acceptance by the god and their sworn adherence to the Creed.
			<ol>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to Wisdom or Charisma, your choice. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to any ability score. </li>
				<li>Gain a +2 Divine Bonus on Diplomacy checks. </li>
				<li>When initiative is rolled or about to be rolled, initiated by a creature you are aware of, you can roll a Diplomacy check as an immediate action to exclude yourself from combat.</li>
				<li>Gain access to the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/charm-person/">Charm Person</a> spell as a spell-like ability, allowing you to cast it a number of times per day equal to your Fu-Xing level. When you do so, treat your Fu-Xing level as the spell level for DC calculation.</li>
				<li>Gain the Diplomacy skill as a class skill. If it is already a class skill, gain a +3 Divine Bonus.</li>
			</ol>

		
		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Powers</b>
			<br><br>As you continue to grow as a follower of Fu-Xing, you will gain access to new powers. Here is a list of powers that have been discovered by previous followers of Fu-Xing in TWE.
			<br> <b> If you revere one aspect more than the other, you may only wield the powers that align with your revered aspect. Doing so grants you a -1 reduction to the FP costs of any Divine Powers aligned with that aspect (minimum 1).</b>
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 1 - Bonds of Love</b>
			<br> You channel the passion of Fu-Xing to form closer bonds with those close to you.
			<br> 
			<br><b><u>Fu - (2 FP) - </u></b> Pick an ally you can see. As an action, you can form a bond of love with this ally, if they are willing. If they are not willing, then they may make a will save against a DC of 10 + your caster level + your charisma.
			<br>This bond appears as a faint pink line connecting you and your ally. If you lose sight of the ally or the ally is knocked unconscious, the bond is broken.
			<br>While the bond is intact, the ally doubles any morale bonuses and gains a bonus on saves against mind-affecting effects and fear equal to your Fu-Xing level.
			<br>If the bond is broken, you gain a bonus to damage rolls equal to twice your Fu-Xing level. This damage applies once per turn to spells as well.
			<br>The bond returns if your ally is brought back into view or is raised back to consciousness.
			<br>The bond remains in existence for 10 minutes.
			<br><b><u>Xing - (2 FP) - </u></b> Pick a number of willing allies within 30 feet up to twice your Fu-Xing level. As an action, you can form bonds of companionship with each of them.
			<br>This bond appears as a faint blue line connecting you and each of your allies. If the allies are moved outside of your 30 foot radius, the bond is broken.
			<br>While the bond is intact, you and your allies gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Fu-Xing level. In addition, if one of the bonded are hit by an attack, the attacker provokes an attack of opportunity from the other bonded allies.
			<br>If the bond is broken, you and your bonded allies spend half the movement cost to move toward the ally with the broken bond.
			<br>The bond returns if your ally is brought back into range.
			<br>The bond remains in existence for 10 minutes.
		</div>

		
		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Judgment</b>
			<br><br> These are the dangers that await you if you fail to uphold the Creed of Fu-Xing or otherwise fall into her judgment.
			<ol>
				<li>You immediately lose all Fu-Xing Divine Powers and Fu-Xing FP. Your Divine Blessings are inverted from bonuses into penalties. </li>
				<li>Your coming is odious. You start all relationships 1 step closer to hostile.</li>
				<li>People who are unfriendly with you are much more likely to attack you.</li>
				<li>Those who once loved you find that harder to do...</li>
			</ol>


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Clerics of Fu-Xing </b>

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Favored Weapon</b>
			<br><br> Fu, the Feminine Aspect, favors the <a target="blank" href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html#Light-Exotic"><b>Bladed Fan</b></a>, a weapon equal parts alluring and deadly.
			<br><br> Xing, the Masculine Aspect favors the <a target="blank" href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html#2H-Arethian"><b>Naginata</b></a>, a weapon perfect for guarding the home.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Channeling Effect </b>
			<br><br> Whenever a cleric (or paladin) channels the power of Fu-Xing, it comes with an additional effect depending on whether the channel is being used to heal or to harm. These effects often incorporate X, where <b>X is the cleric's Fu-Xing level</b>:
			<br><b><u>Healing - </u></b> Affected creatures gain the following effect until the start of your next turn: When a creature would target you directly with a single-target attack or harmful spell, it has a 10X percent (Max 70%) chance of instead choosing to target a creature without this effect. If all creatures in the fight have this effect, then there is a chance the battle ends peacefully. Taking any potentially aggressive action while under this effect removes it.
			<br><b><u>Harming - </u></b> Affected creatures that fail their saves are affected by the Greater Peacebond spell, using X as the spell level for the DC calculation, but this effect ends at the start of your next turn.
