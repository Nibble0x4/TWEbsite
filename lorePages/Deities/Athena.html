	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Athena, Goddess of Wisdom </b>
	<br>
	<br><br>
	Athena is the goddess of wisdom, tactics, and knowledge. She is the patron of learning and the keeper of secrets. No other, mortal or god, has amassed knowledge comparable to that of Athena.
	<br>Among the gods, she is the preeminent source of wisdom. She pays attention and always has. Whether it is learning from the past or predicting the future, her insight is in a class of its own.

	 
	
	<hr>

	<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="header"> Status</b>
			<br><br> Athena was enshrined as the Secondary Goddess of Taria, but has been <b>DETHRONED</b>.
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Personality</b>
	<br> Athena is quiet, quick to learn and slow to speak. She enjoys watching others, giving advice and enabling them to overcome their problems on their own.
She is a firm believer in the ability of mortals to find a way through situations in ways that gods cannot, and invests on educating and guiding mortals toward that end.
If something is of such great importance that Athena herself must handle it, then she will do so in secrecy, leaving the world unaware of any danger.
	<br> Athena is a maiden goddess, but doesn't require her followers to follow her in that.
	<br> Now that she is <b>Dethroned</b>, she has no more say in the path mortals take. She can only watch and hope that she was correct to place her faith in them.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Creed </b>
	<br> To never cease learning. To understanding and live the difference between knowledge and wisdom. To think first in all cases and to act only second. To mark all thoughts with hesitance and all hesitance with the gathering of knowledge. To seek counsel and to give it twofold in return. To put the truth above gain and wisdom above greed. Knowledge is the key, but wisdom is the treasure. To follow nobody and nothing blindly, especially not a deity. To learn from mistakes. Fools do none of these things and fools are repulsive. Take heed, lest you be spat out. 


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Becoming a Follower </b>
	<br> The path to becoming a true follower of a deity is a journey in and of itself. Doing so requires journeying to the deity's shrine and performing acts of devotion that endear you to them. 
	<br><br>When you have proven yourself and gained their favor, you may choose to subject yourself to their Creed and become their follower. Doing so grants you Divine Blessings and a Divine Power. As you continue to follow them faithfully, always living by the Creed, your deity level increases (this level is separate from your character and class levels) and new Divine Powers are attained.
	<br><br> Since Athena has been <b>DETHRONED</b>, properly becoming her follower is no longer available to anyone but clerics.
	<br><br> However, if you break the Creed, you will suffer Divine Judgment from your deity until you atone. Be very careful.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shrine Location</b>
			<br><br> <b>DETHRONED</b>. Athena's shrine was in Camus, Taria.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Acts of Devotion</b>
			<br><br> Athena desires her followers to follow the ideals listed in her creed not just for her, but for themselves and everyone else around them.
			<br> To catch her attention, prioritize learning, teaching, and gathering knowledge. 
			<br> Seeking out that which is hidden. Spreading knowledge that is helpful to be spread.
			<br> Finally, once you have knowledge, exercise solid judgment with that knowledge.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Blessings</b>
			<br><br> These blessings are gained by every new official follower upon their acceptance by the goddess and their sworn adherence to the Creed.
			<ol>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to Intelligence or Wisdom, your choice. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to any ability score. </li>
				<li>Gain a +2 Divine Bonus on Sense Motive checks. </li>
				<li>Whenever you are under the effects of an insight bonus, double the bonus. </li>
				<li>Gain access to the Scrivener's Chant cantrip as a spell-like ability. </li>
				<li>Gain a Knowledge skill of your choice as a class skill. If it already was, then gain a +3 divine bonus to it. </li>
			</ol>

		
		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Powers</b>
			<br><br>As you continue to grow as a follower of Athena, you will gain access to new powers. Here is a list of powers that have been discovered by previous followers of Athena in TWE:
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 1 - ????</b>
			<br> There has yet to be a player who played a follower of Athena in TWE.
		</div>

		
		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Judgment</b>
			<br><br> These are the dangers that await you if you fail to uphold the Creed of Athena or otherwise fall into her judgment.
			<ol>
				<li>You immediately lose all Athena Divine Powers and Athena FP. Your Divine Blessings are inverted from bonuses into penalties. </li>
				<li>Your plans are twisted, as if someone is making moves against you. </li>
				<li>You start to forget key things... </li>
			</ol>


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Clerics of Athena </b>
	<br> It is not necessary to be a Cleric to follow Athena. However, if you wish to begin play as a Cleric who worships the goddess of wisdom, then you may choose to live by her creed and begin as a follower of Athena. Doing so will grant you all the benefits of Athena Level 1. Here is some information specific for clerics of Athena.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Available Domains</b>
			<br>Any cleric of Athena must have at least one of these domains. Any domain spells or powers from these domains used by the cleric gains +1 Caster Level.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Favored Weapon</b>
			<br><br> Athena favors the <a target="blank" href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html#1H-Martial"><b>Heavy Shield</b></a>, a weapon that protects first and grants time to think.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Channeling Effect </b>
			<br><br> Whenever a cleric (or paladin) channels the power of Athena, it comes with an additional effect depending on whether the channel is being used to heal or to harm. These effects often incorporate X, where <b>X is the cleric's Athena level</b>:
			<br><b><u>Healing - </u></b> All affected creatures are granted a +X insight bonus on a single d20 roll made before the start of the cleric's next turn.
			<br><b><u>Harming - </u></b> All affected creatures who fail the save are afflicted with a -X penalty to one d20 roll made on their turn before the cleric's next turn. The DM is in charge of handling which roll this penalty applies to.
