	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Hecate, Mistress of Magic </b>
	<br>
	<br><br>
	Hecate is the goddess of magic, mistress of the arcane, and governess of aether. She is the weaver of spells, the keeper of all the magic known to the residents of TWE.
	<br>Under her authority, magic is restrained or empowered. Some magics have, at her will, been determined to be too dangerous to too twisted to be allowed to run rampant in TWE.
	 
	
	<hr>

	<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="header"> Status</b>
			<br><br> Hecate was enshrined as the Fringe Goddess of Taria, but has been <b>DETHRONED</b>.
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Personality</b>
	<br> Hecate is a goddess of veils, her true personality and intentions always masked from mortal minds. She takes her work seriously, ensuring that magic does not get abused in such a way that may lead to the destruction of the mortal world.
	<br> She is not known for being friendly or understanding, only cold and absolute. The twisted powers that she held back from the world for so long have now been unleashed, and she can at least take solace in knowing that she was right.
	<br> She is haughty with mortals, looking down on them as lowly, greedy, foolish beings that play with powers beyond them without thinking of the consequences.
	<br> Now that she is <b>Dethroned</b>, she can do nothing but watch them deal with the repercussions of their own choices.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Creed </b>
	<br> To ever grow in understanding of the Aether. To cast aside the ideas of sacred and profane, to see all merely for what it is. To master the Aether, controlling and manipulating it to achieve ever greater feats with its unending potential. To understand the methods of magic, true magic, and to understand the results of its use. To stand watch as others cannot, watching for those who would twist the Aether in ways that must not be done. There is no profane and no sacred, but there are limits to what magic the world should know and it falls to you to protect the world from what it will do to itself. To truly understand and guard the Aether, you must push the bounds of what is possible. You are a hypocrite. You push magic where it must not go, thoroughly search and understand every forbidden crevice of the Aether and what it can do. You do this to become the greatest possible threat to the world. Only once this is done can you truly know how to protect it. As you do it, do it with the assurance that you are never alone in your work. Your goddess holds your power in her hand and, if you should fall, will pull it from you and remove you entirely.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Becoming a Follower </b>
	<br> The path to becoming a true follower of a deity is a journey in and of itself. Doing so requires journeying to the deity's shrine and performing acts of devotion that endear you to them. 
	<br><br>When you have proven yourself and gained their favor, you may choose to subject yourself to their Creed and become their follower. Doing so grants you Divine Blessings and a Divine Power. As you continue to follow them faithfully, always living by the Creed, your deity level increases (this level is separate from your character and class levels) and new Divine Powers are attained.
	<br><br> Since Hecate has been <b>DETHRONED</b>, properly becoming her follower is no longer available to anyone but clerics.
	<br><br> However, if you break the Creed, you will suffer Divine Judgment from your deity until you atone. Be very careful.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shrine Location</b>
			<br><br> <b>DETHRONED</b>. Hecate's shrine was north of Motham, Taria.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Acts of Devotion</b>
			<br><br> Hecate desires her followers to grow ever stronger in the understanding and wielding of powerful magic.
			<br> To catch her attention, seek out new magic wherever it can be found, adding it to your power.
			<br> To find others who are abusing magic and stop them by being better.
			<br> Finally, to respect magical barriers...for now.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Blessings</b>
			<br><br> These blessings are gained by every new official follower upon their acceptance by the goddess and their sworn adherence to the Creed.
			<ol>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to Intelligence or Charisma, your choice. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to any ability score. </li>
				<li>Gain a +2 Divine Bonus on Knowledge(Arcana) checks. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 bonus to all DCs for spells you cast. </li>
				<li>Gain access to the Detect Magic cantrip as a spell-like ability. </li>
				<li>Gain a Spellcraft as a class skill. If it already was, then gain a +3 divine bonus to it. </li>
			</ol>

		
		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Powers</b>
			<br><br>As you continue to grow as a follower of Hecate, you will gain access to new powers. Here is a list of powers that have been discovered by previous followers of Hecate in TWE:
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 1 - ????</b>
			<br> There has yet to be a player who played a follower of Hecate in TWE.
		</div>

		
		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Judgment</b>
			<br><br> These are the dangers that await you if you fail to uphold the Creed of Hecate or otherwise fall into her judgment.
			<ol>
				<li>You immediately lose all Hecate Divine Powers and Hecate FP. Your Divine Blessings are inverted from bonuses into penalties. </li>
				<li>You must roll concentration to cast a spell, no matter what. </li>
				<li>The penalty for losing control is steep... </li>
			</ol>


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Clerics of Hecate </b>
	<br> It is not necessary to be a Cleric to follow Hecate. However, if you wish to begin play as a Cleric who worships the goddess of wisdom, then you may choose to live by her creed and begin as a follower of Hecate. Doing so will grant you all the benefits of Hecate Level 1. Here is some information specific for clerics of Hecate.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Available Domains</b>
			<br>Any cleric of Hecate must have at least one of these domains. Any domain spells or powers from these domains used by the cleric gains +1 Caster Level.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Favored Weapon</b>
			<br><br> Hecate favors the <a target="blank" href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html#Light-Simple"><b>Ritual Knife</b></a>, a weapon that was made to serve magical ends.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Channeling Effect </b>
			<br><br> Whenever a cleric (or paladin) channels the power of Hecate, it comes with an additional effect depending on whether the channel is being used to heal or to harm. These effects often incorporate X, where <b>X is the cleric's Hecate level</b>:
			<br><b><u>Healing - </u></b> All affected creatures are granted a +X bonus to their will saves against spells. If they are casters, they can choose to consume this bonus upon casting a spell to increase their effective caster level by 1/2X.
			<br><b><u>Harming - </u></b> Any creature that has at least 1 arcane spell prepared can also be harmed by this channel. If they would already be harmed by this channel, they take an additional X force damage.
