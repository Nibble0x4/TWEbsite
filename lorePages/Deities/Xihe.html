	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Xihe, Sun God </b>
	<br>
	<br><br>  Xihe is the god of the sun, the mighty and lordly being that resides above all and gazes down upon TWE during the day. Xihe brings light and warmth, but his light is not strictly pleasant.
	<br>His First Aspect is a warlike god, one who leads with a strong fist. His people are strong as well, and he drives them toward conquest and glory.
	<br>Her Second Aspect is a protective goddess, one who bathes her children in her warm glow and keeps them safe from all intruders. Her smile glows down on them always, and she watches over them zealously.
	

	 
	
	<hr>

	<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="header"> Status</b>
			<br><br> Xihe is currently enshrined as the Primary God of Areth.
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Personality</b>
	<br>  Xihe's First Aspect is a stalwart, strong, and unyielding god. He is decisive, confident, and passionate. He sleeps during the night and wakes during the day, eager to drive his followers toward greatness.
He is serious, intense, and his zealotry ignites a fire in his followers. He responds promptly to prayer during the day, eager to bless his followers with his power and stride with them toward glory. It is only at night that he rests, taking a reprieve and preparing to rise again in the morning.
	<br>Xihe's Second Aspect is equally zealous, but her passion shows itself in a different way. She is a formidable goddess, but she pours her energy into watching over her people.
During the night, when she can hardly see them, her anxiety grows and grows. Only the breaking of the dawn grants her relief as she rises and casts her all-encompassing gaze over her children.
She, too, is eager to respond to her followers. She wraps them in her warm embrace, protecting them and preserving them for the greatness she knows they will attain.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Creed </b>
	<br> To shine. To embody the sun's light and its power. The sun sits above all, shining warmth on the worthy and scorching the unworthy. The sun rises first in the morning, burning passionately through the day  
from dawn to til dusk. To be like the sun, resting during the night and defining the day by your light. To operate boldly, without restraint. To take what you need, showering those under you
with comfort and beating down your foes without mercy. To lead the way, making yourself so reliable that others can orbit you with confidence. In all you do, give it your all.
If you fizzle, you will fall from your heights. Your deity will not be held back by your failure, and you will be destroyed by the radiance in which you once basked.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Becoming a Follower </b>
	<br> The path to becoming a true follower of a deity is a journey in and of itself. Doing so requires journeying to the deity's shrine and performing acts of devotion that endear you to them. 
	<br><br>When you have proven yourself and gained their favor, you may choose to subject yourself to their Creed and become their follower. Doing so grants you Divine Blessings and a Divine Power. As you continue to follow them faithfully, always living by the Creed, your deity level increases (this level is separate from your character and class levels) and new Divine Powers are attained.
	<br><br> However, if you break the Creed, you will suffer Divine Judgment from your deity until you atone. Be very careful.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shrine Location</b>
			<br><br> Xihe's shrine is located in the Arethian capitol city, Yanor in the Lake.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Acts of Devotion</b>
			<br><br> Xihe desires his followers to act with purpose, unrelenting.
			<br> To catch Xihe's attention, align with his or her values and dedicate yourself to living them in every aspect of your life.
			<br> Xihe has declared Areth to be a sacred land of sacred people. Understanding this and acting accordingly will help you win his favor.
			<br> Finally, take it to heart that Xihe's calling is the greatest thing you could ever aspire to. Moral right and moral wrong must not bend, but they must reshape with this in mind.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Blessings</b>
			<br><br> These blessings are gained by every new official follower upon their acceptance by the god and their sworn adherence to the Creed.
			<br> Followers of Xihe must choose whether to revere the <b>Masculine</b> or <b>Feminine</b> aspect primarily. This changes the Blessings they receive.
			<ol>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to Strength or Wisdom, your choice. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to any ability score. </li>
				<li>If you revere the <b>Masculine</b> Aspect of Xihe, gain a +3 Divine Bonus to Intimidate checks made in strong sunlight. </li>
				<li>If you revere the <b>Feminine</b> Aspect of Xihe, gain a +3 Divine Bonus to Perception checks made in strong sunlight. </li>
				<li>If you revere the <b>Masculine</b> Aspect of Xihe, gain access to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/3rd-party-spells/jon-brazer-enterprises/fear-the-sun/">Fear the Sun</a> as a spell-like ability. You may cast it in this way a number of times per day equal to your Xihe level. </li>
				<li>If you revere the <b>Feminine</b> Aspect of Xihe, gain access to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dancing-lights/">Dancing Lights</a> as a spell-like ability. You may cast it in this way a number of times per day equal to your Xihe level. </li>
				<li>When standing in strong sunlight, reduce the cost of Divine Powers matching your revered Aspect by 1 FP. Reduce the cost by 2 FP if the light is amplified sunlight.</li>
			</ol>

		
		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Powers</b>
			<br><br>As you continue to grow as a follower of Xihe, you will gain access to new powers. Here is a list of powers that have been discovered by previous followers of Xihe in TWE:
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 1 - ????</b>
			<br> There has yet to be a player who played a follower of Xihe in TWE.
		</div>

		
		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Judgment</b>
			<br><br> These are the dangers that await you if you fail to uphold the Creed of Xihe or otherwise fall into her judgment.
			<ol>
				<li>You immediately lose all Xihe Divine Powers and Xihe FP. Your Divine Blessings are inverted from bonuses into penalties. </li>
				<li>Your coming is odious. You start all relationships 1 step closer to hostile.</li>
				<li>You gain light blindness that cannot be mitigated by any other effect.</li>
				<li>The sun is your enemy. Do not let it see you...</li>
			</ol>


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Clerics of Xihe </b>

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Favored Weapon</b>
			<br><br> Xihe's Masculine Aspect favors the <a target="blank" href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html#1H-Arethian"><b>Katana</b></a>, the weapon that cuts a path forward.
			<br><br> Xihe's Feminine Aspect favors the <a target="blank" href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html#Ranged-Arethian"><b>Daikyumi</b></a>, the weapon that rides to the rescue.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Channeling Effect </b>
			<br><br> Whenever a cleric (or paladin) channels the power of Xihe, it comes with an additional effect depending on whether the channel is being used to heal or to harm. These effects often incorporate X, where <b>X is the cleric's Xihe level</b>:
			<br><b><u>Healing - </u></b> Affected creatures are surrounded by hard light, granting them DR/- equal to 2X as long as they stand in direct sunlight. If in amplified sunlight, this becomes 3X.
			<br><b><u>Harming - </u></b> This channel counts as sunlight. If a creature who would not be harmed by this channel is weak to sunlight, then it takes damage from this channel. If a creature normally wounded by this channel is weak to sunlight, it takes double damage from this channel.
