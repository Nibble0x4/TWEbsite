	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Cold </b>
	<br>
	<br><br>
	Cold is one of the four primal forces revered by the ancient Grussian tribes. It is always there, always waiting for the warmth to pass. In Gruss, Cold can be felt more potently than anywhere else in TWE. Freezing, preserving, deadly, and irresistable, Cold can only be held at bay. Heat, warmth, even the inferno of flame is temporary. Cold is the natural state and, in the end, everything returns to it. Cold is inevitable, a constantly testing and trying force that culls the weak and fortifies the strong.

	 
	
	<hr>

	<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="header"> Status</b>
			<br><br> Cold is currently enshrined in Gruss and is protected by the Pettan tribe.
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Cult</b>
	<br> The cult of Cold is a harsh and unforgiving environment. They are a resilient people, strong and patient. They are as severe as the cold they revere and they care only for the resilience of those who come to them. Stoicism is common among them, but not required. Their code of conduct centers on survival of the strongest through community.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Becoming a Follower </b>
	<br> The path to becoming a true follower of a Grussian deity is simple. You must make a pilgrimage to the shrine of the deity and receive the blessing of the Sage of the deity's cult.
	<br><br>When you have proven yourself and gained their favor, you may gain the blessings of Cold and become a follower.
	<br><br> However, you must be sure to remain in good standing with the cult lest your blessings be stripped from you.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shrine Location</b>
			<br><br> The Shrine of Cold is in the Grussian Wilds, on Hell's Lid.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Presence</b>
			<br><br> Grussian deities do not possess personalities or identities. Instead, they are present in the essence that they embody. For followers of Grussian deities, the presence or lack of their revered essence in their surroundings has a large impact on the power they can call on. In any given situation, the GM can tell you the current presence level for your deity. There are six stages of Presence.
			<br> The current Cold Presence will impact the power of your Cold abilities.
			<ul>
				<li><b>-2</b> : There is a supernatural, magical, or extremely potent lack of Cold in your surroundings.</li>
				<li><b>-1</b> : Cold cannot be felt here.</li>
				<li><b>0</b> : Neutrality. Cold can be felt, but not particularly strongly. This is the most common state of presence.</li>
				<li><b>1</b> : Cold can be felt more strongly than normal here. This is the second most common state of presence.</li>
				<li><b>2</b> : Cold can be felt very strongly here.</li>
				<li><b>3</b> : Cold can be felt so strongly here that the experience is borderline divine.</li>
			</ul>

		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Blessings</b>
			<br><br> These blessings are gained by every new official follower upon their acceptance by the god and their sworn adherence to the Creed.
			<ol>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to Constitution or Intelligence, your choice. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to any ability score. </li>
				<li><b>Attuned Spells</b> - Each day, pick a number of spells equal to your Cold level that are attuned with Cold. Gain power and flexibility for those spells when in positive Cold Presence.</li>
				<li>OR <b>Attuned Resilience</b> - Gain DR/profane equal to your Cold level multiplied by Cold Presence (If the presence is positive) </li>
				<li>Gain the ability to cast Ray of Frost as a spell-like ability. When you do so, the damage is 1d4+your Cold lvl and the ray can freeze small patches of water.</li>
				<li>Halve cold damage taken. When struck by a damaging cold attack from a source outside of your control, gain a +X Divine Bonus to attack and damage rolls, including spell damage, and cold spell effects you create gain +1/2X DC (Where X equals your Cold Level) </li>
			</ol>

		
		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Powers</b>
			<br><br>As you continue to grow as a follower of Cold, you will gain access to new powers. Here is a list of powers that have been discovered by previous followers of Cold in TWE:
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 1 - ????</b>
			<br> There has yet to be a follower of Cold played by players in TWE.
		</div>

		
		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Judgment</b>
			<br><br> Cold does not hold grudges. The cult of Cold, however, does. Angering the cult may result in your powers disappearing and them hunting you down...


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Clerics of Cold </b>
	<br> It is not necessary to be a Cleric to follow Cold. However, if you wish to begin play as a Cleric who worships the god of the heavens, then you may choose to live by his creed and begin as a follower of Cold. Doing so will grant you all the benefits of Cold Level 1. Here is some information specific for clerics of Cold.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Available Domains</b>
			<br>Any cleric of Cold must have at least one of these domains. Any domain spells or powers from these domains used by the cleric gains +1 Caster Level.
			<br><br> <a target="blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/water-domain/flowing-subdomain/">Water-Flowing</a>, <a target="blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/water-domain/ice/">Water-Ice</a>, <a target="blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/3rd-party-publishers-domains/rogue-genius-games-domains/ice-domain/">Ice</a>, <a target="blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/3rd-party-publishers-domains/domains-and-subdomains-legendary-games/cold/">Cold</a>
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Favored Weapon</b>
			<br><br> Cold does not have a favored weapon. Instead, a cleric of Cold adds their Cold level to damage with weapons that deal Cold damage.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Channeling Effect </b>
			<br><br> Whenever a cleric (or paladin) channels the power of Cold, it comes with an additional effect depending on whether the channel is being used to heal or to harm. These effects often incorporate X, where <b>X is the cleric's Cold level</b>:
			<br><b><u>Healing - </u></b>  All affected creatures are infused with cold, allowing them to deal X bonus cold damage on their weapon attacks. If they are casting a spell that is cold affiliated, they can add this damage to their spell. If they are casting a damaging spell that is not cold-affiliate, they can change the damage type to cold. In addition, they gain Energy resistance X to cold.
			<br><b><u>Harming - </u></b> The channel harms any fire-affiliate creatures and constructs even if it otherwise wouldn't. If it already would, then it deals 2X bonus cold damage. The damage of this channel counts as cold damage for the purposes of resistances and weaknesses.
