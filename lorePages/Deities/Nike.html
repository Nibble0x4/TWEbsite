	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Nike, Lady of Victory </b>
	<br>
	<br><br>  Nike is the goddess of victory, great harbinger of success and keeper of the garlands given only to those who have conquered.
She was the Primary Goddess of Enthan during its founding and its conquering years. The emperors of Enthan have long since paid her tribute, but in recent generations she has taken a back seat to Vulcan.
In peaceful times, she sits proudly to the side as a symbol of the greatness that has been achieved, a garland in and of herself.
However, if war were to rise again, she would be raised back into the spotlight to lead her people toward their great future.
	

	 
	
	<hr>

	<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="header"> Status</b>
			<br><br> Nike is currently enshrined as the Secondary Goddess of Enthan.
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Personality</b>
	<br>  Nike is a proud and severe goddess, one who expects the best both from herself and from her followers. She has exacting standards, though she doesn't care much for morality.
Though she is pragmatic, efficient, and ruthless, she is not without honor. Glory is important, and success without glory is empty to her.
She often speaks to her followers, offering a warm word of encouragement when they struggle, a proud smile of praise when they triumph, and a poignant rebuke when they falter.
Unlike other deities, she does not make specific requests of her followers often. When she does, however, they are very important and should be undertaken quickly.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Creed </b>
	<br> To succeed, To let nothing stand in the way of victory. One way or another, to be victorious and glorious. To choose your tasks carefully, lest you risk defeat. To stand by your choice of task and succeed in it, regardless of result, once made. If your success would be shameful, do not choose the task. From such folly, nonse shall save you. Your goddess shall turn against you, and you shall fail one last time.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Becoming a Follower </b>
	<br> The path to becoming a true follower of a deity is a journey in and of itself. Doing so requires journeying to the deity's shrine and performing acts of devotion that endear you to them. 
	<br><br>When you have proven yourself and gained their favor, you may choose to subject yourself to their Creed and become their follower. Doing so grants you Divine Blessings and a Divine Power. As you continue to follow them faithfully, always living by the Creed, your deity level increases (this level is separate from your character and class levels) and new Divine Powers are attained.
	<br><br> However, if you break the Creed, you will suffer Divine Judgment from your deity until you atone. Be very careful.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shrine Location</b>
			<br><br> Nike's Shrine is the middle of the Enthan capitol city, Great Enthan.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Acts of Devotion</b>
			<br><br> The goddess of victory enjoys it when mortals succeed, and do so gloriously, regardless of what it takes to do so.
			<br> For those who seek her favor, seek out challenging and worthwhile tasks and overcome them.
			<br> Give due honor to others who have done well, praising their success.
			<br> Give blunt instruction to those who fail, that they may succeed instead.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Blessings</b>
			<br><br> These blessings are gained by every new official follower upon their acceptance by the god and their sworn adherence to the Creed.
			<ol>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to Strength or Charisma, your choice. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to any ability score. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus on all skill checks. </li>
				<li>When you roll a natural 20, gain 1 Nike FP. When you roll a natural 1, lose 1 Nike FP.</li>
				<li>Gain access to the Virtue cantrip as a spell-like ability. If you can already cast this, then number of temporary HP you grant is equal to 1 + your Nike level.</li>
			</ol>

		
		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Powers</b>
			<br><br>As you continue to grow as a follower of Nike, you will gain access to new powers. Here is a list of powers that have been discovered by previous followers of Nike in TWE:
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 1 - ????</b>
			<br> There has yet to be a player who played a follower of Nike in TWE.
		</div>

		
		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Judgment</b>
			<br><br> These are the dangers that await you if you fail to uphold the Creed of Nike or otherwise fall into his judgment.
			<ol>
				<li>You immediately lose all Nike Divine Powers and Nike FP. Your Divine Blessings are inverted from bonuses into penalties. </li>
				<li>You must follow the Pathfinder rules of critical confirmation when you roll a critical success. In addition, you take a -4X penalty on critical confirmation rolls.</li>
				<li>Natural 1s are much, much more dangerous...</li>
			</ol>


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Clerics of Nike </b>
	<br> It is not necessary to be a Cleric to follow Nike. However, if you wish to begin play as a Cleric who worships the god of the heavens, then you may choose to live by his creed and begin as a follower of Nike. Doing so will grant you all the benefits of Nike Level 1. Here is some information specific for clerics of Nike.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Available Domains</b>
			<br>Any cleric of Nike must have at least one of these domains. Any domain spells or powers from these domains used by the cleric gains +1 Caster Level.
			<br><br> <a target="blank" href="">Artifice-Construct</a>, 
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Favored Weapon</b>
			<br><br> Nike favors the <a target="blank" href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html#1H-Martial"><b>Sword Cane</b></a>, a danger concealed in a symbol of age.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Channeling Effect </b>
			<br><br> Whenever a cleric (or paladin) channels the power of Nike, it comes with an additional effect depending on whether the channel is being used to heal or to harm. These effects often incorporate X, where <b>X is the cleric's Nike level</b>:
			<br><b><u>Healing - </u></b> Each affected creature that critically succeeds on a roll or has a target critically fail against one of their effects before the start of your next turn gains 5X temporary HP. If the critically succeeded roll is an attack roll, the temporary HP gained is instead equal to 2X(Y) where Y equals the critical multiplier of the weapon used.
			<br><b><u>Harming - </u></b> Each affected creature that fails its save has its critical multiplier reduced by 1 until the start of your next turn.
