	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Yin and Yang, Twin Deities </b>
	<br>
	<br><br>  Yin and Yang are the twin deities, the extreme embodiment of the Arethian deities' dual natures. Yin, the goddess of order, and Yang, the god of chaos, the two couldn't be more different.
	<br>They are opposites, always opposed, and yet their contradiction lies in their sharing of the same throne.
	<br>Yin is cold, calm, quiet, and passive. She watches from the dark and the shadow with mind always moving, always sorting and planning. She hates nothing more than being surprised, preferring everything to be predictable as it ought to be.
	<br>Yang is warm, burning with restless action. He cannot stand to see things remain stagnant and his body is always moving, always changing and breaking down in search of what comes next. His insatiable curiosity despises the boring and mundane.
	<br>Together, these equal and opposite beings rule over their contrary but connected realm. Chaos, Order, the incessant balance that must be held between the two. Luck, the seemingly natural balance of outcome, and even the concept of complementation falls under their joint purview.
	

	 
	
	<hr>

	<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="header"> Status</b>
			<br><br> Yin and Yang are currently enshrined in Arkei as the Fringe Deities of Areth.
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Personality</b>
	<br>  Yin is meticulous, reserved, and slow to speak. She weighs her words carefully, measuring them against the situation as her mind races to predict what will happen next. <br>She always thinks ahead, every action she takes is a step in her grand plan.
	<br>She is dependable, always replying to her followers in a methodical manner. Her powers grant her followers tools to help keep things in line, ever progressing toward the future she has so carefully planned.
	<br>The difficult part for followers of Yin lies in knowing what she is planning. Yin never speaks of her plans aloud, lest her brother hear her and ruin everything.
	<br>Yang is quick, outgoing, and prefers to be surprised by the results of his actions. Thinking about them ahead of time ruins the fun for him, and he tries his best to avoid doing that whenever possible.
	<br>He is easily bored, but makes his own fun. He delights in seeing things move, change, break and become something new. The joy of motion, expression, and thwarting his sister's silly schemes keeps a smile on his face.
	<br>To his followers, Yang is a breath of fresh air that comes and goes at will. He is unreliable, only responding to calls occasionally, but he speaks freely and candidly in all exchanges.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Creed </b>
	<br> The twin deities have different creeds, depending one which aspect you revere. 
	<br><br>	Yin: To maintain order. To keep yourself and those around you in line, holding to set principles and acting accordingly. To strive to act in ways that grant confidence to those who observe you.
	<br>To demonstrate a predictability of character and value that makes it clear what you believe and desire. To preserve that which is, as it ought to be, such that degradation is held at bay.
	<br>To sort and understand, drawing truth from the chaotic and solidifying it into the timeless. To understand and maintain balance, such that the world remains as it is and does not descend into madness.
	<br><br>	Yang: To foment chaos. To never allow yourself or those around you to settle into stagnation, instead changing at every opportunity. To rise and fall, feeling every peak and valley as the wonder that it is.
	<br>To learn and unlearn, growing and shrinking and expanding constantly as you come to new experiences and situations. To break down what is, that it may be spectacular, and to watch what appears in its place.
	<br>To search and find, ever releasing and grasping as you experience newer and newer. To reach for and shake the balance, ensuring that the world never has its balance taken away by those who would hold it down.
	<br><br>	Balance: To hold the balance. To keep in check the two forces of Yin and Yang, respecting and revering both in equal measure. 
	<br>To understand the different strengths and weaknesses of chaos and order, action and inaction, masculine and feminine, openness and privacy, light and darkness. To live this difference and to help others come to do the same.
	<br> To meld and merge the creeds of both Yin and Yang, removing the absolutes and replacing them with carefully and haphazardly, logically and emotionally balanced implementation.

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Becoming a Follower </b>
	<br> The path to becoming a true follower of a deity is a journey in and of itself. Doing so requires journeying to the deity's shrine and performing acts of devotion that endear you to them. 
	<br><br>When you have proven yourself and gained their favor, you may choose to subject yourself to their Creed and become their follower. Doing so grants you Divine Blessings and a Divine Power. As you continue to follow them faithfully, always living by the Creed, your deity level increases (this level is separate from your character and class levels) and new Divine Powers are attained.
	<br><br> However, if you break the Creed, you will suffer Divine Judgment from your deity until you atone. Be very careful.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shrine Location</b>
			<br><br> The shrines of Yin and Yang are both located in Arkei, Areth.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Acts of Devotion</b>
			<br><br> <b>Yin</b> desires for her followers to live and act orderly, living by a defined personal code and respecting the laws that exist.
			<br>To catch Yin's attention, promote peace and tranquility, upholding the law and punishing lawbreakers.
			<br><b>Yang</b> desires for his followers to live and act spontaneously, acting on whatever feels best in the moment and breaking any laws in their way.
			<br>To catch Yang's attention, keep things lively, defying stuffy laws and regulations and living to do it all again.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Blessings</b>
			<br><br> These blessings are gained by every new official follower upon their acceptance by the god and their sworn adherence to the Creed.
			<br> Followers of Yin-Yang must choose whether to revere the <b>Masculine</b> or <b>Feminine</b> aspect primarily. This changes the Blessings they receive.
			<ul>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to Intelligence or Charisma, your choice. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to any ability score. </li>
			</ul>
			<ol> <b>Yin's Blessings</b>

					<li>Whenever you or a creature within your reach would roll on the Arcane Interference table, you may choose to flip a coin. If heads, do not roll on the table. </li>
					<li>When wielding a weapon or wearing equipment aligned with Law, gain an improvement fitting to the item. </li>
			</ol>
			<ol> <b>Yang's Blessings</b>
					<li>Gain access to Protection from Law as a spell-like ability. You may cast it in this way a number of times per day equal to your Yang level. You may expend 3 uses of this ability to cast the spell communally. </li>

					<li>When wielding a weapon or wearing equipment aligned with Chaos, gain an improvement fitting to the item. </li>
			</ol>
			<ul>
				<li>Gain a Profession as a class skill with 1 rank in it.</li>
				<li>Gain a +4 Divine Bonus on a Profession skill of your choice. </li>
				<li>If you revere the <b>Feminine</b> Aspect of Yin-Yang, gain access to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/soften-earth-and-stone/">Soften Earth and Stone</a> as a spell-like ability. You may cast it in this way a number of times per day equal to your Yin-Yang level. </li>
				<li>If you revere the <b>Masculine</b> Aspect of Yin-Yang, gain access to <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/binding-earth/">Bind Earth</a> as a spell-like ability. You may cast it in this way a number of times per day equal to your Yin-Yang level. </li>
			</ul>

		
		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Powers</b>
			<br><br>As you continue to grow as a follower of Yin-Yang, you will gain access to new powers. Here is a list of powers that have been discovered by previous followers of Yin and Yang in TWE.
			<br> <b> Yin and Yang have distinct sets of powers. You may only use the powers of the deity you revere. If you chose to revere both, you may use the powers of both BUT you must pay the higher cost to do so.</b>
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 1 - ????</b>
			<br> There has yet to be a player who played a follower of Yin or Yang in TWE.
		</div>

		
		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Judgment</b>
			<br><br> These are the dangers that await you if you fail to uphold the Creed of Yin-Yang or otherwise fall into her judgment.
			<ol>
				<li>You immediately lose all Yin-Yang Divine Powers and Yin-Yang FP. Your Divine Blessings are inverted from bonuses into penalties. </li>
				<li>You find yourself supremely out of balance. Shift the natural result of all your rolls down by 1 (unless it is a natural 20).</li>
				<li>Neither Order nor Chaos approve of you, the one thing they agree on...</li>
			</ol>


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Clerics of Yin and Yang </b>
	<br> It is not necessary to be a Cleric to follow Yin-Yang. However, if you wish to begin play as a Cleric who worships the god of the heavens, then you may choose to live by his creed and begin as a follower of Yin-Yang. Doing so will grant you all the benefits of Yin-Yang Level 1. Here is some information specific for clerics of Yin-Yang.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Available Domains</b>
			<br>Any cleric of <b>Yin</b> must have at least one of these domains. Any domain spells or powers from these domains used by the cleric gains +1 Caster Level.
			<br> If you revere Balance, you must have one of these domains and one from Yang's list below.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Favored Weapon</b>
			<br><br> Yin favors the <a target="blank" href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html#Light-Arethian"><b>Tonfa</b></a>, weapons that block and strike.
			<br><br> Yang favors the <a target="blank" href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html#Light-Arethian"><b>Sai</b></a>, weapons that strike and block.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Channeling Effect </b>
			<br><br> Whenever a cleric (or paladin) channels the power of Yin or Yang, it comes with an additional effect depending on whether the channel is being used to heal or to harm. These effects often incorporate X, where <b>X is the cleric's Yin-Yang level</b>:
			<br><b><u>Healing - </u></b> Affected creatures may choose to modify one d20 roll they make before the start of the cleric's next turn, after the die has been rolled. <br><b>If they revere Yin</b>, they may shift the natural result by 1. <b>If they revere Yang</b>, they may roll again but must accept the new result. <b>If they revere balance</b>, then they gain a +2 bonus on the total of the roll.
			<br><b><u>Harming - </u></b> The damage from this channel counts as Chaotic or Lawful, if you revere one or the other, and deals damage to creatures of the opposite alignment. If a creature would already be damaged by this, then they suffer 2X bonus damage. If you revere balance, this damage counts as Neutral and deals damage to creatures of either Lawful or Chaotic alignment with no chance for bonus damage.
