	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> War </b>
	<br>
	<br><br>
	War is one of the four primal forces revered by the ancient Grussian tribes. It is not ever-present, like the others, but the possibility of it is always there. It will always arise between humans, bringing death and destruction with it, but it also heralds progress, improvement, and the culling of the weak.
	<br>War is about more than senseless violence. It embodies the great struggle between groups, peoples, ideologies, and the best that humanity can muster.
	<br>In Gruss, it has always been a struggle to keep the land sacred and Grussian. Only through War has its people known peace, and that will never change.
	

	 
	
	<hr>

	<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="header"> Status</b>
			<br><br> War is currently enshrined in Gruss and is protected by the Habor tribe.
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Cult</b>
	<br> The cult of War is a highly militaristic organization. They are actively waging war with Areth, so they are highly hierarchical and regimented. They are organized, serious, determined, and ever-growing in skill and experience. The cult of War hates apathy and laziness. They are not meatheads, however, and have created a war college around War's shrine to educate their number on tactics and history.

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Becoming a Follower </b>
	<br> The path to becoming a true follower of a Grussian deity is simple. You must make a pilgrimage to the shrine of the deity and receive the blessing of the Sage of the deity's cult.
	<br><br>When you have proven yourself and gained their favor, you may gain the blessings of War and become a follower.
	<br><br> However, you must be sure to remain in good standing with the cult lest your blessings be stripped from you.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shrine Location</b>
			<br><br> The Shrine of War is in Habor territory, near the border of the Wilds.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Presence</b>
			<br><br> Grussian deities do not possess personalities or identities. Instead, they are present in the essence that they embody. For followers of Grussian deities, the presence or lack of their revered essence in their surroundings has a large impact on the power they can call on. In any given situation, the GM can tell you the current presence level for your deity. There are six stages of Presence.
			<br> The current War Presence will impact the power of your War abilities.
			<ul>
				<li><b>-2</b> : There is a supernatural, magical, or extremely potent lack of War in your surroundings.</li>
				<li><b>-1</b> : War cannot be felt here.</li>
				<li><b>0</b> : Neutrality. War can be felt, but not particularly strongly. This is the most common state of presence.</li>
				<li><b>1</b> : War can be felt more strongly than normal here. This is the second most common state of presence.</li>
				<li><b>2</b> : War can be felt very strongly here.</li>
				<li><b>3</b> : War can be felt so strongly here that the experience is borderline divine.</li>
			</ul>

		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Blessings</b>
			<br><br> These blessings are gained by every new official follower upon their acceptance by the god and their sworn adherence to the Creed.
			<ol>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to Strength or Intelligence, your choice. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to any ability score. </li>
				<li><b>Attuned Spells</b> - Each day, pick a number of spells equal to your War level that are attuned with War. Gain power and flexibility for those spells when in positive War Presence.</li>
				<li>OR <b>Attuned Resilience</b> - Gain DR/profane equal to your War level multiplied by War Presence (If the presence is positive) </li>
				<li>Gain the ability to cast Tactical Adaptation as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to your War level, using your character level in place of your magus level. When you do this, you may cast the spell multiple times to meet feat prerequisites.</li>
				<li>Gain the ability to be treated as if you also possess any Teamwork feat also possessed by an ally. </li>
			</ol>

		
		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Powers</b>
			<br><br>As you continue to grow as a follower of War, you will gain access to new powers. Here is a list of powers that have been discovered by previous followers of War in TWE:
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 1 - ????</b>
			<br> There has yet to be a follower of War played by players in TWE.

		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Judgment</b>
			<br><br> War does not hold grudges. The cult of War, however, does. Angering the cult may result in your powers disappearing and them hunting you down...


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Clerics of War </b>
	<br> It is not necessary to be a Cleric to follow War. However, if you wish to begin play as a Cleric who worships the god of the heavens, then you may choose to live by his creed and begin as a follower of War. Doing so will grant you all the benefits of War Level 1. Here is some information specific for clerics of War.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Available Domains</b>
			<br>Any cleric of War must have at least one of these domains. Any domain spells or powers from these domains used by the cleric gains +1 Caster Level.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Favored Weapon</b>
			<br><br> War does not have a favored weapon. Clerics of War instead choose any two weapons they favor and treat those as the favored weapons of War.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Channeling Effect </b>
			<br><br> Whenever a cleric (or paladin) channels the power of War, it comes with an additional effect depending on whether the channel is being used to heal or to harm. These effects often incorporate X, where <b>X is the cleric's War level</b>:
			<br><b><u>Healing - </u></b> All affected creatures gain a +X bonus that they can choose to apply once to any tactical bonus they would receive. (EX: One instance of a flanking bonus would add 2+X to an attack roll)
			<br><b><u>Harming - </u></b> All affected creatures that fail the save are rendered unable to benefit from battlefield tactical advantages or take attacks of opportunity. This channel harms any creatures belonging to an opposing warring faction. If this channel would already harm them, add 2X damage to the channel.
