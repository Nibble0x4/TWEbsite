	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Artemis, Lady of the Hunt </b>
	<br>
	<br><br>
	Artemis is the maiden goddess of the Hunt and the goddess of the moon, patron of those who survive off of and protect the land. She is closely related to the natural world, though she remains distinct from it and asserts herself as dominant over all other life. She encourages the same in all her followers.
As a maiden goddess, she requires her followers swear an oath of abstinence in order to match her single-minded dedication to her work.

	 
	
	<hr>

	<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="header"> Status</b>
			<br><br> Artemis is currently enshrined as the People's Goddess of Taria.
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Personality</b>
	<br> Artemis is a goddess of few words, preferring to speak with her actions. She is often quiet and reserved, restraining herself from engaging in the politics and drama of the other deities. She is precise and strategic, planning each step out before she takes it in order to ensure success. As the People's Goddess of Taria, she is the quiet and reliable backbone of the union that the people rely on every day. Whether she is favoring game hunters who gather food in times of peace or driving the warriors of the Tri-Villages to the defense of their home, Artemis devotes herself mind and body to her task.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Creed </b>
	<br> To act always as if observed. To be observed only when intended. To follow your Lady without fail, to question your orders without fail. To grow without ceasing and to remain ever-vigilant. To speak only what is needed, and little else. To respect and protect, as these are the way to respect. To act as part of the sisterhood in body and in soul. Gain power through practice. Seek your quarry without ceasing. Be swift, be decisive, be faithful. If you betray, tremble. Your Lady leads by eample. 


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Becoming a Follower </b>
	<br> The path to becoming a true follower of a deity is a journey in and of itself. Doing so requires journeying to the deity's shrine and performing acts of devotion that endear you to them. 
	<br><br>When you have proven yourself and gained their favor, you may choose to subject yourself to their Creed and become their follower. Doing so grants you Divine Blessings and a Divine Power. As you continue to follow them faithfully, always living by the Creed, your deity level increases (this level is separate from your character and class levels) and new Divine Powers are attained.
	<br><br> However, if you break the Creed, you will suffer Divine Judgment from your deity until you atone. Be very careful.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shrine Location</b>
			<br><br> Artemis' shrine is located in the center between the Tri-Villages of eastern Taria, equidistant from Morta, Carta, and Werta.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Acts of Devotion</b>
			<br><br> The quiet goddess is unlikely to speak to her followers in most cases. Instead, she expects them to do what needs to be done and trust that nothing escapes her keen eyes.
			<br>For those who seek her favor, honing your skills is the first step. Hunting is a perfect example, but there are other possibilities as well.
			<br>Catching Artemis' attention is simply a matter of mimicking her. Become an expert, plan your moves, and execute your hunt flawlessly. The more difficult your quarry, the more approval you will gain.
			<br>Sacrificing the fruits of your hunt is an excellent move, but you must not be wasteful. Sacrifice the best parts and be sure to use the rest. Waste will not please the goddess.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Blessings</b>
			<br><br> These blessings are gained by every new official follower upon their acceptance by the goddess and their sworn adherence to the Creed.
			<ol>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to Dexterity or Wisdom, your choice. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to any ability score. </li>
				<li>Gain a +2 Divine Bonus to Perception. </li>
				<li>Gain Low-Light Vision up to 60 feet. </li>
				<li>Reduce any miss chances by 40% when attacking. </li>
				<li>Gain access to the Know Direction cantrip as a spell-like ability. </li>
				<li>Gain Survival as a class skill. If it already was, then gain a +3 divine bonus to it. </li>
			</ol>

		
		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Powers</b>
			<br><br>As you continue to grow as a follower of Artemis, you will gain access to new powers. Here is a list of powers that have been discovered by previous followers of Artemis in TWE:
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 1 - Huntress' Precision (1-2 FP)</b>
			<br> Your enemies are not a threat, they are either an obstacle or your prey. Hunt them. You may spend 1 action to use one of the below abilities on a single target you can see.
			<br> 
			<br><b><u>Hunt - (1 FP) - </u></b> Pick a single taret within view. You gain a bonus equal to twice your Artemis level on stealth, perception, sense motive, knowledge, and survival checks against that target. You may only have one Hunt target at a time.
			<br><b><u>Snare - (2 FP) - </u></b> Upon a successful hit against a Hunt target, the target must make a save against a DC of 10 + Artemis level + your wisdom modifier. The type of save is chosen by you. You can choose one of:
			<br> - <b>Fortitude</b> - If the target fails, their bodies become tired of the hunt. They become fatigued. If they are already fatigued, they become exhausted. In 10 rounds, they will have another fortitude save. Failing the second save renders them unconscious.
			<br> - <b>Reflex</b> - If the target fails, they become entangled by a divine snare, reducing all their movement speeds by 5 ft. per Artemis level. Any temporary bonuses to their speed are negated and they must make a second reflex save if they wish to teleport. The effect lasts for 4 rounds. 
			<br> - <b>Will</b> - If the target fails, their minds are overrun with fear of beng prey. They are unable to cast spell or use magical devices, and any spells or effects they are sustaining or that are being sustained on them are dispelled. They are shaken X, where X is your Artemis level.
			<br><b><u>Destroy - (1 FP) - </u></b> Gain a bonus equal to your Artemis level (max 4) on attack rolls, ac, damage rolls, DCs, and saves against your target. This lasts for 1 round per Artemis level. After one round has passed, 2 FP can be spent as a free action to remove the cap for the rest of the duration.
			<br>

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 3 - Huntress' Critical (0-2 FP)</b>
			<br>When you strike true, there is a moment where you feel as though your goddess has guided your attack, striking with divine precision and power.
			<br> 
			<br> When you roll a natural 20 to crit the target of your <b> Hunt </b>, you ignore crit immunity and DR. You may spend 1 FP to increase your critical multiplier on this attack by 1. You may spend another 1 FP more to reduce the target's crit-guard by 2X, where X is your Artemis level, for 1 minute.

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 4 - Helpless at the Huntress' Hand (1 FP)</b>
			<br> You have learned how to hunt a creature without killing it, exercising a divine grace of sorts.
			<br> 
			<br> When you strike a creature with a blow that would kill it, you may instead choose to convert and of your damage dealt to nonlethal damage by spending 1 FP. The creature is stunned for a minute upn waking, even if it is healed.

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 5 - Thrill of the Chase (2 FP)</b>
			<br> The chase is the most thrilling part of the hunt, whether you are predator or prey. You thrive here, channeling the speed and endurance of your divine lady.
			<br> 
			<br> When you are hunting or being hunted in a chase, you can spend 2 FP to double your base movement speed and increase your constitution score by 5 times your Artemis level for the purposes of calculating endurance related statistics (such as breath holding or running duration).

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 6 - Aspect of the Huntress (3-4 FP)</b>
			<br> You take on an aspect of your goddess, shaping you into an apex predator. You may only have one of these aspects active at a time. You can choose to end one early as a free action.
			<br> 
			<br><b><u>Form - (3 FP) - </u></b> Change shape into an animal form. This form must be a reflection of the servant, embodying how they are, how they see themselves, and how their goddess sees them. They may switch as an action between this animal form and their base form at will for a number of minutes equal to their Artemis level. If the duration ends while they are in their animal form, they may remain that way as long as they'd like before transforming back.
			<br><b><u>Physicality - (4 FP) - </u></b> Embody perfectly the physical ideal of your goddess. Gain a bonus to your Dexterity score equal to your Artemis level for an equal number of minutes.
			<br><b><u>Mentality - (3 FP)</u></b> - Take on the inescapable mind of your goddess, gaining a bonus to your Wisdom score equal to your Artemis level for an equal number of minutes.

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 7 - Huntress' Takedown (4 FP)</b>
			<br> You no longer rely on your own skills alone. Using your faith, you can call upon your goddess to guide your weapon and enhance your mortal success into a divine one.
			<br> 
			<br> Upon landing a called shot, spend 4 FP to double the weapon's base damage. If the called shot is also a soft crit, then the soft crit becomes a normal critical hit.

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 8 - Bow of the Huntress(Attuned) (8 FP)</b>
			<br> Your lady has granted you permission to use her favorite bow, forming a replica that has been shrunken and softened to be handled by mortal hands.
			<br> 
			<br> As an action, conjure a mortal replica of <a target="blank" href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html#Unique-Weapons">Toxobeles, Artemis' divine weapon</a>. The weapon has a +5 enhancement bonus and remains available to you for 1 hour.
			
		</div>

		
		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Judgment</b>
			<br><br> These are the dangers that await you if you fail to uphold the Creed of Artemis or otherwise fall into her judgment.
			<ol>
				<li>You immediately lose all Artemis Divine Powers and Artemis FP. Your Divine Blessings are inverted from bonuses into penalties. </li>
				<li>In addition, you get the sense that you are being hunted. You are permanently Shaken X where X is equal to half your Artemis Level. You cannot sleep well, requiring twice as much rest in order to properly recover HP and spells. </li>
				<li>Something is now hunting you... </li>
			</ol>
