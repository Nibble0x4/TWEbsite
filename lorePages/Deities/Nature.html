	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Nature </b>
	<br>
	<br><br>
	Nature is one of the four primal forces revered by the ancient Grussian tribes. It surrounds all, representing the raw, untouched world as it ought to be. It is that which all came from and that which all shall return to.
	<br>Nature is a broad concept. It lives in the trees, in the beasts, and in the sky. It lives in the sea and the rain, the snow and the flame. Nature is all but what man has become, what man has made.
	<br>In Gruss, the concept of Nature is perhaps the most revered of all. Generations upon generations of Grussians were raised with the understanding that to disturb the natural order was to damage Gruss.

	 
	
	<hr>

	<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="header"> Status</b>
			<br><br> Nature is currently enshrined in Gruss and is protected by the Novali tribe.
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Cult</b>
	<br> The cult of Nature is fair, painfully so. They keep the balance, respect the food chain, and tend to the area surrounding the Shrine of Nature. The shrine is within Novali territory, serving as a reminder to its people never to forget their heritage. The cult of Nature despises manmade things and the progression of civilization whenever it infringes on the natural way.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Becoming a Follower </b>
	<br> The path to becoming a true follower of a Grussian deity is simple. You must make a pilgrimage to the shrine of the deity and receive the blessing of the Sage of the deity's cult.
	<br><br>When you have proven yourself and gained their favor, you may gain the blessings of Nature and become a follower.
	<br><br> However, you must be sure to remain in good standing with the cult lest your blessings be stripped from you.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shrine Location</b>
			<br><br> The Shrine of Nature is in the Wilds, near the border of Novali territory.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Presence</b>
			<br><br> Grussian deities do not possess personalities or identities. Instead, they are present in the essence that they embody. For followers of Grussian deities, the presence or lack of their revered essence in their surroundings has a large impact on the power they can call on. In any given situation, the GM can tell you the current presence level for your deity. There are six stages of Presence.
			<br> The current Nature Presence will impact the power of your Nature abilities.
			<ul>
				<li><b>-2</b> : There is a supernatural, magical, or extremely potent lack of Nature in your surroundings.</li>
				<li><b>-1</b> : Nature cannot be felt here.</li>
				<li><b>0</b> : Neutrality. Nature can be felt, but not particularly strongly. This is the most common state of presence.</li>
				<li><b>1</b> : Nature can be felt more strongly than normal here. This is the second most common state of presence.</li>
				<li><b>2</b> : Nature can be felt very strongly here.</li>
				<li><b>3</b> : Nature can be felt so strongly here that the experience is borderline divine.</li>
			</ul>

		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Blessings</b>
			<br><br> These blessings are gained by every new official follower upon their acceptance by the god and their sworn adherence to the Creed.
			<ol>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to Constitution or Charisma, your choice. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to any ability score. </li>
				<li><b>Attuned Spells</b> - Each day, pick a number of spells equal to your Nature level that are attuned with Nature. Gain power and flexibility for those spells when in positive Nature Presence.</li>
				<li>OR <b>Attuned Resilience</b> - Gain DR/profane equal to your Nature level multiplied by Nature Presence (If the presence is positive) </li>
				<li>Gain the ability to cast Summon Nature's Ally at a level equal to your Nature level. When you do, you may only summon one creature. You may cast this spell once per day, but may banish or resummon the same creature as many times as you would like as long as it hasn't been reduced to 0 HP.</li>
				<li>Gain the ability to ignore natural difficult terrain and damage from natural terrain. Beasts and plants do not pick a fight with you or those with you unless provoked. </li>
			</ol>

		
		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Powers</b>
			<br><br>As you continue to grow as a follower of Nature, you will gain access to new powers. Here is a list of powers that have been discovered by previous followers of Nature in TWE:
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 1 - ????</b>
			<br> There has yet to be a follower of Nature played by players in TWE.
		</div>

		
		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Judgment</b>
			<br><br> Nature does not hold grudges. The cult of Nature, however, does. Angering the cult may result in your powers disappearing and them hunting you down...


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Clerics of Nature </b>
	<br> It is not necessary to be a Cleric to follow Nature. However, if you wish to begin play as a Cleric who worships the god of the heavens, then you may choose to live by his creed and begin as a follower of Nature. Doing so will grant you all the benefits of Nature Level 1. Here is some information specific for clerics of Nature.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Available Domains</b>
			<br>Any cleric of Nature must have at least one of these domains. Any domain spells or powers from these domains used by the cleric gains +1 Caster Level.
			<br><br> <a target="blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/animal-domain/">Animal</a>, <a target="blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/chaos-domain/entropy-subdomain/">Chaos-Entropy</a>, <a target="blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/plant-domain/">Plant</a>, <a target="blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/scalykind-domain/">Scalykind</a>, <a target="blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/vermin-domain/">Vermin</a>, <a target="blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/weather-domain/">Weather</a>

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Favored Weapon</b>
			<br><br> Nature does not have a favored weapon. Clerics of Nature instead are proficient with any weapon made entirely from non-metal natural materials and may use the Focus abilities of these weapons without the feat.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Channeling Effect </b>
			<br><br> Whenever a cleric (or paladin) channels the power of Nature, it comes with an additional effect depending on whether the channel is being used to heal or to harm. These effects often incorporate X, where <b>X is the cleric's Nature level</b>:
			<br><b><u>Healing - </u></b>  All affected creatures gain freedom of movement, allowing them to ignore natural difficult terrain and gaining a +2X bonus on acrobatics, climb, swim, and escape artist checks made to traverse or escape until the end of the cleric's next turn.
			<br><b><u>Harming - </u></b> All affected creatures within 5 feet of the ground or vegetation who fail the save are grappled by appropriate foliage, reducing movement speed to 0. Attempting to escape is an action with DC equal to this channel + X.
