	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Zeus, Lord of the Sky </b>
	<br>
	<br><br>
	Zeus is the god of the heavens and wielder of lightning. The winds blow at his command and all beings that live in the air owe him homage and respect. He is the god of the air and holds a position higher than most other deities due to his incredible power and authority. He requires his followers to imitate him, growing in strength and virtue as they seek to make the world a better place.

	 
	
	<hr>

	<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="header"> Status</b>
			<br><br> Zeus is currently enshrined as the Primary God of Enthan.
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Personality</b>
	<br> Zeus is a proud and powerful god. He claims to be the King of Gods, despite holding no such position officially, and he has the power to back up his claim. With the awe-inspiring power of lightning and a domain that stretches over all others, Zeus has large shoes to fill and a larger personality to fill it with. To his foes, he is an insatiably cruel and vindictive god who rains destruction on those who anger him. To his followers, however, he is a warm and protective lord who gathers his people about him in the peaceful town of Motham. He is a strict god with high standards, but his favor is powerful to match.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Creed </b>
	<br> To never waver in your convictions, to know and exercise what you know to be true. To hold the world to a standard and to hold yourself to one higher. To strive for and attain ever-increasing power, that you might overlook all opposition and effect your will for the better. To strike down those who threaten the peace and to nurture and protect those who seek it. To stand true as a paragon and never to falter, for there is always one above you looking down. Your god is above you always, and he practices what he preaches.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Becoming a Follower </b>
	<br> The path to becoming a true follower of a deity is a journey in and of itself. Doing so requires journeying to the deity's shrine and performing acts of devotion that endear you to them. 
	<br><br>When you have proven yourself and gained their favor, you may choose to subject yourself to their Creed and become their follower. Doing so grants you Divine Blessings and a Divine Power. As you continue to follow them faithfully, always living by the Creed, your deity level increases (this level is separate from your character and class levels) and new Divine Powers are attained.
	<br><br> However, if you break the Creed, you will suffer Divine Judgment from your deity until you atone. Be very careful.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shrine Location</b>
			<br><br> Zeus' shrine is located at the peak of Mount Olympus in central Taria.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Acts of Devotion</b>
			<br><br> Zeus is not subtle about what he desires. He wants virtuous followers, ones with strong wills and resolute morals. 
			<br> To catch his attention, it helps to form a strong moral framework and live by it unapologetically.
			<br> The more consistent you can live and the more you can impact the others around you, whether positively or negatively by the consistent application of your beliefs, the better.
			<br> Finally, showing deference and a desire to learn from Zeus is important to gaining his favor.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Blessings</b>
			<br><br> These blessings are gained by every new official follower upon their acceptance by the god and their sworn adherence to the Creed.
			<ol>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to Strength or Constitution, your choice. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to any ability score. </li>
				<li>Gain a +2 Divine Bonus on Intimidate checks. </li>
				<li>Halve electric damage taken. When struck by a damaging electric attack from a source outside of your control, gain a +X Divine Bonus to attack and damage rolls, including spell damage, and electric spell effects you create gain +1/2X DC (Where X equals your Zeus Level)</li>
				<li>Gain access to the Feather Fall spell as a spell-like ability that can be used a number of times per day equal to twice your Zeus level. </li>
				<li>Gain Fly as a class skill. If it already was, then gain a +3 divine bonus to it. </li>
			</ol>

		
		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Powers</b>
			<br><br>As you continue to grow as a follower of Zeus, you will gain access to new powers. Here is a list of powers that have been discovered by previous followers of Zeus in TWE:
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 1 - Heaven's Judgement</b>
			<br> Call upon Zeus to judge your foes, test others, or to reward you with an ally.
			<br><br> This ability takes two actions to perform and can only be used if there is a clear path from you to the sky above. 
			<br><b><u>Smiting Bolt - (3 FP) - </u></b> Call down a bolt of lightning from above to strike anywhere within 60 feet. The bolt deals 3d8 damage per Zeus level to a single target with a Reflex save to negate the damage ( DC = 10 + Zeus lvl + Strength ). If the bolt strikes you instead of a creature, you can choose to channel the damage into the next attack you make that turn or hurl it as a ranged touch attack.
			<br><b><u>Winds of Tribulation - (1 FP) - </u></b> A powerful wind blows from behind you, but any creature who is without deception and is standing true to their beliefs can resist it. Any creature not doing those things will be pushed back.
			<br><b><u>Friendly Front - (1 FP) - </u></b> A wisp of cloud comes to your aid, taking on a semi-physical form and following your commands. The wisp can fly with a speed of 30 feet and has both vision and hearing. It cannot speak to any but followers of Zeus.
			The wisp has 10 AC and 5 HP per Zeus level. It is semi-incorporeal and takes half damage from most physical attacks.
			It can carry along small, very light items that would be blown about by a breeze.
			It can, on your turn, deliver a small jolt to a creature within 5 feet of it. This deals 1d3 electric damage.
		</div>

		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 2 - Weather Cast</b>
			<br> Change the weather in a radius around you. This ability's cost depends on your choices:
			<br><b>Weather:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Clear - [1] </li>
				<li>Cloudy - [1] </li>
				<li>Rainy - [2] </li>
				<li>Thunderstorm - [4] </li>
				<li>Windstorm - [4] </li>
				<li>True Storm - [6] </li>
			</ul>
			<br><b>Radius:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>10 feet - [0] </li>
				<li>100 feet - [2] </li>
				<li>1 mile - [4] </li>
				<li>10 miles - [6] </li>
			</ul>
			<br><b>Action:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Full-Round - [Doubles the Cost] </li>
				<li>1 Minute - [Cost Remains the Same] </li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 3 - Heavenly Agreement</b>
			<br> Depending on the current weather you are undergoing, your Smiting Bolt ability is changed:
			<ul>
				<li>Thunderstorm - [Double the damage dealt by the bolt] </li>
				<li>Windstorm - [The bolt is replaced with a concentrated tornado of wind, dealing bludgeoning damage and hitting with enough force to throw a Medium creature 10 feet per Zeus level. The tornado remains on the battlefield for 1 minute. It does not deal damage anymore, but it remains in place unless you spend an action to move it up to 30 feet] </li>
				<li>True Storm - [As a part of using Smiting Bolt, both the Bolt and the Tornado effects occur independently] </li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 4 - Sky Drop</b>
			<br> Call upon the power of the sky and send someone to meet it.
			<br><br> <b>(2)</b> -  A creature you can see within 90 feet must make a Will save (DC 10 + Zeus lvl + Constitution).
			<br>If the creature fails, they are hurled 50 feet into the air per Zeus level you have.
			<br>If there is an obstruction blocking their path, then the creature hits the obstruction, takes 1d6 damage, and begins to fall from there.
		</div>
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 5 - Oxygen Deprivation</b>
			<br> Manipulate the oxygen of the air around you.
			<br><br> <b>(3)</b> -  A creature you can see within 60 feet must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + Zeus lvl + Constitution) or else have their oxygen severely limited.
			<br>This effect lasts for 1 round per Zeus level. During this time, the creature cannot make sounds louder than a faint gasp and cannot provide verbal components for spells.
			<br>The creature may attempt another save on their turn as an action. If they succeed, the effect ends. If they fail, they cannot attempt again and they become Confused for the duration.
			<br><br> <b>(2)</b> -  You gain control over the flow of oxygen in a 60 foot radius around you. You cannot use this control to deny breath to creatures, but you can use it to deny fuel for flame, provide assistance in breathing, or other similar effects
		</div>

		
		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Judgment</b>
			<br><br> These are the dangers that await you if you fail to uphold the Creed of Zeus or otherwise fall into his judgment.
			<ol>
				<li>You immediately lose all Zeus Divine Powers and Zeus FP. Your Divine Blessings are inverted from bonuses into penalties. </li>
				<li>The winds are always against you. You cannot fly and gain a weakness to electricity. </li>
				<li>The sky is not safe and lightning may strike you down at any time. </li>
			</ol>


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Clerics of Zeus </b>
	<br> It is not necessary to be a Cleric to follow Zeus. However, if you wish to begin play as a Cleric who worships the god of the heavens, then you may choose to live by his creed and begin as a follower of Zeus. Doing so will grant you all the benefits of Zeus Level 1. Here is some information specific for clerics of Zeus.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Available Domains</b>
			<br>Any cleric of Zeus must have at least one of these domains. Any domain spells or powers from these domains used by the cleric gains +1 Caster Level.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Favored Weapon</b>
			<br><br> Zeus favors the <a target="blank" href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html#Ranged-Simple"><b>Javelin</b></a>, a weapon hurled to smite.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Channeling Effect </b>
			<br><br> Whenever a cleric (or paladin) channels the power of Zeus, it comes with an additional effect depending on whether the channel is being used to heal or to harm. These effects often incorporate X, where <b>X is the cleric's Zeus level</b>:
			<br><b><u>Healing - </u></b> All affected creatures are infused with electricity, allowing them to deal X bonus electric damage on their weapon attacks. If they are casting a spell that is air affiliated, they can add this damage to their spell. If they are casting a damaging spell that is not air-affiliate, they can change the damage type to electric. In addition, they gain Energy resistance X to electricity.
			<br><b><u>Harming - </u></b> The channel harms any earth-affiliate creatures even if it otherwise wouldn't. If it already would, then it deals 2X bonus electric damage. The damage of this channel counts as electric damage for the purposes of resistances and weaknesses.
