	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Zeus, Lord of the Sky </b>
	<br>
	<br><br>
	Zeus is the god of the heavens and wielder of lightning. The winds blow at his command and all beings that live in the air owe him homage and respect. He is the god of the air and holds a position higher than most other deities due to his incredible power and authority. He requires his followers to imitate him, growing in strength and virtue as they seek to make the world a better place.

	 
	
	<hr>

	<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="header"> Status</b>
			<br><br> Zeus is currently enshrined as the Primary God of Enthan.
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Personality</b>
	<br> Zeus is a proud and powerful god. He claims to be the King of Gods, despite holding no such position officially, and he has the power to back up his claim. With the awe-inspiring power of lightning and a domain that stretches over all others, Zeus has large shoes to fill and a larger personality to fill it with. To his foes, he is an insatiably cruel and vindictive god who rains destruction on those who anger him. To his followers, however, he is a warm and protective lord who gathers his people about him in the peaceful town of Motham. He is a strict god with high standards, but his favor is powerful to match.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Creed </b>
	<br> To never waver in your convictions, to know and exercise what you know to be true. To hold the world to a standard and to hold yourself to one higher. To strive for and attain ever-increasing power, that you might overlook all opposition and effect your will for the better. To strike down those who threaten the peace and to nurture and protect those who seek it. To stand true as a paragon and never to falter, for there is always one above you looking down. Your god is above you always, and he practices what he preaches.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Becoming a Follower </b>
	<br> The path to becoming a true follower of a deity is a journey in and of itself. Doing so requires journeying to the deity's shrine and performing acts of devotion that endear you to them. 
	<br><br>When you have proven yourself and gained their favor, you may choose to subject yourself to their Creed and become their follower. Doing so grants you Divine Blessings and a Divine Power. As you continue to follow them faithfully, always living by the Creed, your deity level increases (this level is separate from your character and class levels) and new Divine Powers are attained.
	<br><br> However, if you break the Creed, you will suffer Divine Judgment from your deity until you atone. Be very careful.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shrine Location</b>
			<br><br> Zeus' shrine is located at the peak of Mount Olympus in central Taria.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Acts of Devotion</b>
			<br><br> Zeus is not subtle about what he desires. He wants virtuous followers, ones with strong wills and resolute morals. 
			<br> To catch his attention, it helps to form a strong moral framework and live by it unapologetically.
			<br> The more consistent you can live and the more you can impact the others around you, whether positively or negatively by the consistent application of your beliefs, the better.
			<br> Finally, showing deference and a desire to learn from Zeus is important to gaining his favor.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Blessings</b>
			<br><br> These blessings are gained by every new official follower upon their acceptance by the god and their sworn adherence to the Creed.
			<ol>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to Strength or Constitution, your choice. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to any ability score. </li>
				<li>Gain a +2 Divine Bonus on Intimidate checks. </li>
				<li>Halve electric damage taken. When struck by a damaging electric attack from a source outside of your control, gain a +X Divine Bonus to attack and damage rolls, including spell damage, and electric spell effects you create gain +1/2X DC (Where X equals your Zeus Level)</li>
				<li>Gain access to the Feather Fall spell as a spell-like ability that can be used a number of times per day equal to twice your Zeus level. </li>
				<li>Gain Fly as a class skill. If it already was, then gain a +3 divine bonus to it. </li>
			</ol>

		
		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Powers</b>
			<br><br>As you continue to grow as a follower of Zeus, you will gain access to new powers. Here is a list of powers that have been discovered by previous followers of Zeus in TWE:
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 1 - ????</b>
			<br> There has yet to be a player who played a follower of Zeus in TWE.
		</div>

		
		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Judgment</b>
			<br><br> These are the dangers that await you if you fail to uphold the Creed of Zeus or otherwise fall into his judgment.
			<ol>
				<li>You immediately lose all Zeus Divine Powers and Zeus FP. Your Divine Blessings are inverted from bonuses into penalties. </li>
				<li>The winds are always against you. You cannot fly and gain a weakness to electricity. </li>
				<li>The sky is not safe and lightning may strike you down at any time. </li>
			</ol>


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Clerics of Zeus </b>
	<br> It is not necessary to be a Cleric to follow Zeus. However, if you wish to begin play as a Cleric who worships the god of the heavens, then you may choose to live by his creed and begin as a follower of Zeus. Doing so will grant you all the benefits of Zeus Level 1. Here is some information specific for clerics of Zeus.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Available Domains</b>
			<br>Any cleric of Zeus must have at least one of these domains. Any domain spells or powers from these domains used by the cleric gains +1 Caster Level.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Favored Weapon</b>
			<br><br> Zeus favors the <a target="blank" href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html#Ranged-Simple"><b>Javelin</b></a>, a weapon hurled to smite.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Channeling Effect </b>
			<br><br> Whenever a cleric (or paladin) channels the power of Zeus, it comes with an additional effect depending on whether the channel is being used to heal or to harm. These effects often incorporate X, where <b>X is the cleric's Zeus level</b>:
			<br><b><u>Healing - </u></b> All affected creatures are infused with electricity, allowing them to deal X bonus electric damage on their weapon attacks. If they are casting a spell that is air affiliated, they can add this damage to their spell. If they are casting a damaging spell that is not air-affiliate, they can change the damage type to electric. In addition, they gain Energy resistance X to electricity.
			<br><b><u>Harming - </u></b> The channel harms any earth-affiliate creatures even if it otherwise wouldn't. If it already would, then it deals 2X bonus electric damage. The damage of this channel counts as electric damage for the purposes of resistances and weaknesses.
