	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Mercury, Master of the Forge </b>
	<br>
	<br><br> Mercury is the patron god of all those who travel through the world of TWE. He is the one the wanderer prays to, the one the lost cries out to, and the bringer of hope and comfort to the people who make the roads their home for any length of time. Under his auspices do caravans roll, expeditions hike, and patrols march. 
	

	 
	
	<hr>

	<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="header"> Status</b>
			<br><br> Mercury is currently enshrined as the Primary God of Enthan.
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Personality</b>
	<br> Mercury is quick and 


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Creed </b>
	<br> To show hospitality to travelers and to assist them in their journey to their destination. All travelers have a destination. All men are travelers. You serve the lord of travel, so to those who travel you are a servant. To deal treacherously or maliciously with a traveler without sufficient cause is a punishable offense. If you lose sight of this purpose, you will find that your own journey is not far from its end.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Becoming a Follower </b>
	<br> The path to becoming a true follower of a deity is a journey in and of itself. Doing so requires journeying to the deity's shrine and performing acts of devotion that endear you to them. 
	<br><br>When you have proven yourself and gained their favor, you may choose to subject yourself to their Creed and become their follower. Doing so grants you Divine Blessings and a Divine Power. As you continue to follow them faithfully, always living by the Creed, your deity level increases (this level is separate from your character and class levels) and new Divine Powers are attained.
	<br><br> However, if you break the Creed, you will suffer Divine Judgment from your deity until you atone. Be very careful.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shrine Location</b>
			<br><br> Mercury's shrine is located in the capitol city of Great Enthan.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Acts of Devotion</b>
			<br><br> The industrious Master of the Forge seeks devotion through acts of creation, destruction, and reconstruction.
			<br> For those who seek his favor, completing ambitious tasks like those above will endear him to you.
			<br> Catching Mercury's attention is simply a matter of mimicking him. Hone your craft, create quality goods, and never be afraid to burn something down and start anew when it is rotten.
			<br> Sacrifice to Mercury comes in the form of being willing to destroy that which means something to you in order to make something better in its place. This can be items, relationships, systems, whatever.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Blessings</b>
			<br><br> These blessings are gained by every new official follower upon their acceptance by the god and their sworn adherence to the Creed.
			<ol>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to Strength or Intelligence, your choice. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to any ability score. </li>
				<li>Gain a +2 Divine Bonus on Craft checks. </li>
				<li>Halve fire damage taken. When struck by a damaging fire attack from a source outside of your control, gain a +X Divine Bonus to attack and damage rolls, including spell damage, and fire spell effects you create gain +1/2X DC (Where X equals your Mercury Level)</li>
				<li>Gain access to the Produce Flame spell as a spell-like ability that can be used a number of times per day equal to twice your Mercury level.</li>
				<li>Gain Craft as a class skill. If it already was, then gain a +3 divine bonus to it. </li>
			</ol>

		
		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Powers</b>
			<br><br>As you continue to grow as a follower of Mercury, you will gain access to new powers. Here is a list of powers that have been discovered by previous followers of Mercury in TWE:
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 1 - Mercuryic Heat</b>
			<br> You are infused with the flames of Mercury. You can spend it to burn all in your path.
			<br> 
			<br><b><u>Smoldering - (2 FP) - </u></b> You gain 1d4 per Mercury level fire damage that you can expend on any attack or fire spell in the next 10 minutes. You can add this damage to a number of attacks or spells equal to your Mercury level. You must declare the use of this ability before you roll the attack. If the attack misses, the flame is still expended.
			<br><b><u>Raging - (4 FP) - </u></b> Choose one attack or fire spell. That attack gains 4d8 per Mercury level fire damage. If the attack misses, the flame is reduced by 1d8 but is not fully spent. If the spell affects multiple targets, this bonus damage is halved.
		</div>

		
		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Judgment</b>
			<br><br> These are the dangers that await you if you fail to uphold the Creed of Mercury or otherwise fall into his judgment.
			<ol>
				<li>You immediately lose all Mercury Divine Powers and Mercury FP. Your Divine Blessings are inverted from bonuses into penalties. </li>
				<li>Your forge refuses to light and you gain a weakness to fire. </li>
				<li>Flame is very volatile around you... </li>
			</ol>


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Clerics of Mercury </b>
	<br> It is not necessary to be a Cleric to follow Mercury. However, if you wish to begin play as a Cleric who worships the god of the heavens, then you may choose to live by his creed and begin as a follower of Mercury. Doing so will grant you all the benefits of Mercury Level 1. Here is some information specific for clerics of Mercury.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Available Domains</b>
			<br>Any cleric of Mercury must have at least one of these domains. Any domain spells or powers from these domains used by the cleric gains +1 Caster Level.
			<br><br> <a target="blank" href="">Artifice</a>, <a target="blank" href="">Community</a>, <a target="blank" href="">Earth-Metal</a>, <a target="blank" href="">Erosion</a>, <a target="blank" href="">Destruction</a>, <a target="blank" href="">Fire</a>, <a target="blank" href="">Glory-Honor</a>, <a target="blank" href="">Good-Agathion</a>, <a target="blank" href="">Nobility</a>, <a target="blank" href="">Protection-Defense</a>, <a target="blank" href="">Protection-Fortifications</a>, <a target="blank" href="">Ruins</a>, <a target="blank" href="">Strength-Resolve</a>, <a target="blank" href="">Sun-Light</a>
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Favored Weapon</b>
			<br><br> Mercury favors the <a target="blank" href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html#1H-Martial"><b>Warhammer</b></a>, a weapon to build and to break but still leaves room to protect.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Channeling Effect </b>
			<br><br> Whenever a cleric (or paladin) channels the power of Mercury, it comes with an additional effect depending on whether the channel is being used to heal or to harm. These effects often incorporate X, where <b>X is the cleric's Mercury level</b>:
			<br><b><u>Healing - </u></b> All affected creatures are infused with flame, allowing them to deal X bonus fire damage on their weapon attacks. If they are casting a spell that is flame affiliated, they can add this damage to their spell. If they are casting a damaging spell that is not flame-affiliate, they can change the damage type to fire. In addition, they gain Energy resistance X to fire.
			<br><b><u>Harming - </u></b> The channel harms any water-affiliate creatures and constructs even if it otherwise wouldn't. If it already would, then it deals 2X bonus fire damage.
