	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Mercury, God of Travel </b>
	<br>
	<br><br> Mercury is the patron god of all those who travel through the world of TWE. He is the one the wanderer prays to, the one the lost cries out to, and the bringer of hope and comfort to the people who make the roads their home for any length of time. Under his auspices do caravans roll, expeditions hike, and patrols march. 
	

	 
	
	<hr>

	<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="header"> Status</b>
			<br><br> Mercury is currently enshrined as the Primary God of Enthan.
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Personality</b>
	<br> Mercury is quick both in mind and body, always keeping busy with some task or another. He is fascinated and delighted by all people who move. Coincidentally, it is not only physical motion that excites him. Any journey, whether physical, emotional, or otherwise has his attention. He urges his followers on, encouraging them to continue their journeys and to help others continue theirs. To remain still is to become boring, in the eyes of Mercury, and he is a god who can find wonder in anything that doesn't bore him. The common people are well acquainted with him and his followers, seeing their smiling faces often on the roads, always offering a helping hand.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Creed </b>
	<br> To show hospitality to travelers and to assist them in their journey to their destination. All travelers have a destination. All men are travelers. You serve the lord of travel, so to those who travel you are a servant. To deal treacherously or maliciously with a traveler without sufficient cause is a punishable offense. If you lose sight of this purpose, you will find that your own journey is not far from its end.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Becoming a Follower </b>
	<br> The path to becoming a true follower of a deity is a journey in and of itself. Doing so requires journeying to the deity's shrine and performing acts of devotion that endear you to them. 
	<br><br>When you have proven yourself and gained their favor, you may choose to subject yourself to their Creed and become their follower. Doing so grants you Divine Blessings and a Divine Power. As you continue to follow them faithfully, always living by the Creed, your deity level increases (this level is separate from your character and class levels) and new Divine Powers are attained.
	<br><br> However, if you break the Creed, you will suffer Divine Judgment from your deity until you atone. Be very careful.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shrine Location</b>
			<br><br> Mercury's shrine is located south of Port Thargas, north of the Entho-Tarian Pass.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Acts of Devotion</b>
			<br><br> The compassionate patron of travel wishes his followers to travel, see the world, and cultivate a love for it and its people.
			<br> For those who seek his favor, find travelers and assist them, being a warm guiding light to those who walk the roads.
			<br> Catching Mercury's attention is simply a matter of mimicking him. Guide others through difficult times of all kinds.
			<br> Sacrifice to Mercury comes in the form of exercising hospitality in Mercury's name.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Blessings</b>
			<br><br> These blessings are gained by every new official follower upon their acceptance by the god and their sworn adherence to the Creed.
			<ol>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to Dexterity or Charisma, your choice. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to any ability score. </li>
				<li>Gain a +10 Divine Bonus to your movement speed. </li>
				<li>Gain a +4 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity triggered by movement.</li>
				<li>Gain access to the Message cantrip as a spell-like ability. If you can already cast this, then you gain the ability to do it as a swift action.</li>
				<li>Gain access to the Guidance cantrip as a spell-like ability. If you can already cast this, then the bonus increases to 1+your Mercury level. </li>
			</ol>

		
		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Powers</b>
			<br><br>As you continue to grow as a follower of Mercury, you will gain access to new powers. Here is a list of powers that have been discovered by previous followers of Mercury in TWE:
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 1 - ????</b>
			<br> There has yet to be a player who played a follower of Mercury in TWE.
		</div>

		
		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Judgment</b>
			<br><br> These are the dangers that await you if you fail to uphold the Creed of Mercury or otherwise fall into his judgment.
			<ol>
				<li>You immediately lose all Mercury Divine Powers and Mercury FP. Your Divine Blessings are inverted from bonuses into penalties. </li>
				<li>You find that the dangers of the road are more common and deadly. </li>
				<li>Your path is prone to wander, and you are likely to lose your way... </li>
			</ol>


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Clerics of Mercury </b>
	<br> It is not necessary to be a Cleric to follow Mercury. However, if you wish to begin play as a Cleric who worships the god of the heavens, then you may choose to live by his creed and begin as a follower of Mercury. Doing so will grant you all the benefits of Mercury Level 1. Here is some information specific for clerics of Mercury.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Available Domains</b>

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Favored Weapon</b>
			<br><br> Mercury favors the <a target="blank" href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html#2H-Simple"><b>Lantern Staff</b></a>, a weapon to guide the lost through the darkness.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Channeling Effect </b>
			<br><br> Whenever a cleric (or paladin) channels the power of Mercury, it comes with an additional effect depending on whether the channel is being used to heal or to harm. These effects often incorporate X, where <b>X is the cleric's Mercury level</b>:
			<br><b><u>Healing - </u></b> All affected creatures gain a +5X ft bonus to their movement speed.
			<br><b><u>Harming - </u></b> All affected creatures that fail their save suffer a -5X penalty to movement speed.
