	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Death </b>
	<br>
	<br><br>
	Death is one of the four primal forces revered by the ancient Grussian tribes. It waits eternally, forever lurking beyond the flimsy veil that the living rely on. It is the peace and oblivion that serves as eternal rest from wearisom life.
	<br>"Death cannot be stopped, only slowed." That mentality is common, but fundamentally misunderstands Death. It is not out actively hunting the living, it doesn't need to be. It waits for the living to inevitably come to it.
	<br>If it does come for you, then it is time to make your peace. Few and far between are the instances where Death had to venture to this side of the veil to claim souls. However, it has never once failed.

	 
	
	<hr>

	<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="header"> Status</b>
			<br><br> Death is currently enshrined in Gruss and is protected by the Pettan tribe.
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Cult</b>
	<br> Few people understand and appreciate the value and fragility of life better than the cult of Death. They live every day with potent awareness of what lies at the end, and they do not fear it. They respect it and, for many, it is a source of hope and security. They give everything they have every day, savoring the experience and looking forward to the rest they know they will have one day.


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Becoming a Follower </b>
	<br> The path to becoming a true follower of a Grussian deity is simple. You must make a pilgrimage to the shrine of the deity and receive the blessing of the Sage of the deity's cult.
	<br><br>When you have proven yourself and gained their favor, you may gain the blessings of Death and become a follower.
	<br><br> However, you must be sure to remain in good standing with the cult lest your blessings be stripped from you.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shrine Location</b>
			<br><br> The Shrine of Death is in the Grussian Wilds, between the Twin Peaks.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Presence</b>
			<br><br> Grussian deities do not possess personalities or identities. Instead, they are present in the essence that they embody. For followers of Grussian deities, the presence or lack of their revered essence in their surroundings has a large impact on the power they can call on. In any given situation, the GM can tell you the current presence level for your deity. There are six stages of Presence.
			<br> The current Death Presence will impact the power of your Death abilities.
			<ul>
				<li><b>-2</b> : There is a supernatural, magical, or extremely potent lack of Death in your surroundings.</li>
				<li><b>-1</b> : Death cannot be felt here.</li>
				<li><b>0</b> : Neutrality. Death can be felt, but not particularly strongly. This is the most common state of presence.</li>
				<li><b>1</b> : Death can be felt more strongly than normal here. This is the second most common state of presence.</li>
				<li><b>2</b> : Death can be felt very strongly here.</li>
				<li><b>3</b> : Death can be felt so strongly here that the experience is borderline divine.</li>
			</ul>

		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Blessings</b>
			<br><br> These blessings are gained by every new official follower upon their acceptance by the god and their sworn adherence to the Creed.
			<ol>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to Constitution or Wisdom, your choice. </li>
				<li>Gain a +1 Divine Bonus to any ability score. </li>
				<li><b>Attuned Spells</b> - Each day, pick a number of spells equal to your Death level that are attuned with Death. Gain power and flexibility for those spells when in positive Death Presence.</li>
				<li>OR <b>Attuned Resilience</b> - Gain DR/profane equal to your Death level multiplied by Death Presence (If the presence is positive) </li>
				<li>Gain the ability to cast the Disrupt Undead cantrip as a spell-like ability. When you do so, the damage is 1d8 + your Death lvl and you can choose to heal undead instead of damaging them. An undead creature can only be healed in this way once per day.</li>
				<li>Gain immunity to death effects and negative levels. If you see a creature die, you can give it a proper burial by spending 8 hours. If you do, then the soul of the creature can accompany you before passing on. If it does not want to, you can roll a Will save against them to force them to. You add your Death level on Will saves against the soul. While a soul accompanies you, they can manifest as a specter at will and can communicate. They cannot normally interact with their surroundings. However, you can channel Death's power a number of times per day equal to your Death level to allow them to use a spectral version of an ability they knew in life (the details are subject to GM approval).
				<br>You can force the soul to hide and be quiet if you succeed on a Will save against them. You cannot be accompanied by more than 1 soul at a time. When a soul is released, they pass on and do not return. The longer a soul remains with you, the more of its memory it forgets. </li>
			</ol>

		
		<p class="body-text"> <br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Powers</b>
			<br><br>As you continue to grow as a follower of Death, you will gain access to new powers. Here is a list of powers that have been discovered by previous followers of Death in TWE:
		<div class="classFeature">
			<b class="classFeatureSubheader">Level 1 - ????</b>
			<br> There has yet to be a follower of Death played by players in TWE.
		</div>

		
		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="subheader"> Divine Judgment</b>
			<br><br> Death does not hold grudges. The cult of Death, however, does. Angering the cult may result in your powers disappearing and them hunting you down...


	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Clerics of Death </b>
	<br> It is not necessary to be a Cleric to follow Death. However, if you wish to begin play as a Cleric who worships the god of the heavens, then you may choose to live by his creed and begin as a follower of Death. Doing so will grant you all the benefits of Death Level 1. Here is some information specific for clerics of Death.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Available Domains</b>
			<br>Any cleric of Death must have at least one of these domains. Any domain spells or powers from these domains used by the cleric gains +1 Caster Level.
			<br><br> <a target="blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/darkness-domain/loss/">Darkness-Loss</a>, <a target="blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/death-domain/">Death</a>, <a target="blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/glory-domain/legend-subdomain/">Glory-Legend</a>, <a target="blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/knowledge-domain/memory/">Knowledge-Memory</a>, <a target="blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/nobility-domain/martyr/">Nobility-Martyr</a>, <a target="blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/repose-domain/">Repose</a>, <a target="blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/ruins/">Ruins</a>
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Favored Weapon</b>
			<br><br> Death does not have a favored weapon. Clerics of Death instead gain the power to absorb any negative energy damage dealt through a weapon, gaining the damage dealt as temporary HP that is lost first but does not stack.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Channeling Effect </b>
			<br><br> Whenever a cleric (or paladin) channels the power of Death, it comes with an additional effect depending on whether the channel is being used to heal or to harm. These effects often incorporate X, where <b>X is the cleric's Death level</b>:
			<br><b><u>Healing - </u></b>  All affected creatures remove 1 negative level, if they have one. If the creature is a hostile undead, then they must make a save to halve the healing or else treat the cleric as a trusted friend.
			If the hostile undead is under the control of another creature, then the save is made by the controlling creature instead.
			<br><b><u>Harming - </u></b> If the affected creature fails its save against this channel, then it gains X negative levels (These levels do not stack).
