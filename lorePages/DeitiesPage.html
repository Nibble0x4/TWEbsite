	<p class="top-text"> <b class="subheader"> Deities of TWE </b>
	<br>
	<br><br>
	The land of That Which Exists is governed by a set of <b>17 known deities</b>, each ruling over their own domains. The gods of this world are powerful and their influence is very present, both <b>directly</b> and <b>indirectly</b> through the actions of their followers.
	<br>
	<br>
	The Deities of TWE are a <b>culturally-impacted</b> set of beings. Each deity, in order to have their powers influence the world directly, requires a <b>Seat of Power</b>. In order to have a Seat of Power, a <b>Shrine</b> must be built in the name of the deity and a <b>High Priest</b> agreed upon. Only then may the deity act in the world. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Because of the way the deities are <b>enshrined</b>, the actual form and personality each godly being takes is dependent on the <b>culture</b> that enshrined it. This can be seen in the natures of the established deities. The goddess of wisdom, Athena, was enshrined by the people of Taria. She, along with Hecate, Zeus, and Artemis, are distinctly different from Tu-Shen or Fu-Xing, the deities of the earth and sun who are enshrined in Areth. Similarly, the deities of Cold and War are both revered not as beings but as forces of nature by the tribes of Gruss to the north, a stark contrast to Vulcan, Mercury, and Saturn who are enshrined in Enthan.
	<br>
	<br>
	Gods, in TWE, are not untouchable. If their Shrines are raided and their High Priests slain, then their Seats of Power become vulnerable. If a deity loses their Seat of Power, then they are cut off from the mortal world. They are not killed, but their influence is greatly limited. A deity who lost their Seat is called <b>Dethroned</b>, and a dethroned deity can be returned. If a culture rallies, constructing a new shrine and choosing a new High Priest, they can enshrine their deity once more. Notably, it has been discovered that the culture has a great deal of power over the manifestation of the deity when this is done, meaning the dethroning of a god may lead to great changes in their disposition, values, and even identity. This is especially true if a deity is dethroned and then enshrined by a <b>different culture</b>.

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Pantheons</b>
	<br> There are 17 known gods of TWE, but it is helpful to classify them into individual pantheons. Each Region of TWE has 1-4 deities currently aligned with them.
	<br><br>
	In each of the 3 more civilized Provinces of TWE, the deities tend to fall into a pattern:
	<br> <b>A Primary Deity</b> is seen as the leader of the deities of the Province. It is held in highest esteem and is often the most powerful and difficult to dethrone. Usually, the Primary Deity is attributed with the defense and ultimate success of the Province.
	<br> <b>A Secondary Deity</b> fills the role of right-hand deity to the Primary. It is not the most powerful, but is largely responsible for the support and success of the Primary. Secondary Deities, while not held with quite the same reverence as the Primary, are still incredibly strong.
	<br> <b>A People's Deity</b> is the one with whom the lay people of the Province are most acquainted. They are not feared as the Primary and Secondary are, but they are more loved. Their powers and followers are more common and more often encountered by the common people, especially in smaller settlements. 
	<br> <b>A Fringe Deity</b> inspires fear and mystery even in the people of their own Province. Fringe Deities do not make their teachings and personalities well known, and their followers are often sequestered from the rest of society. Because of this, the people fear and respect them without ever truly understanding what their powers and motivations are.
