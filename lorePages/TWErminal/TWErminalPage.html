She was attacked when she was young and was saved by a poor but very strong boy who never spoke. He was dimwitted but loyal, and the two became fast friends. She developed an ideology, believing that it was the responsibility of those in power to either use their power to fix the world or else have it taken from them. Her father and mother laughed at her suggestion. Being incredibly clever, she decided that she would pioneer this ideology herself and soon inherited the family fortune after a tragic accident. She called her friend Ronan and he served as her bodyguard as she spread her influence under the fake identity of a crime lord called 'The Big Man,' making deals and orchestrating the falls of important figures.
