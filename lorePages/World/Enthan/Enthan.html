	<br>
	<br><br>
	The Enthan Empire is the Roman-inspired Western Province, an orderly and efficient land ruled by a line of emperors descended from the mythical King Henthan.
	<br>
	<br>
	This page gives a basic overview of the Enthan Province, including its history, structure, priorities, prime exports, religions, geography, cities, culture, traditions, and political relations.

	<br> 
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="">Founding</a> </b>
		<br> The legends of King Henthan are many, but few historians dare to try and separate fact from fiction. It is known that he existed, that great warrior of myth who, seeking a stable country where peace and order were plentiful, took up arms to beat back the chaos and establish the thriving city of Great Enthan on the plains of the province that would one day bear his name.
		<br><br>
		The legends speak of incredible acts of power, wit, and wisdom. He tamed the greatest of the Gilgryphs, the immortal Golden Gilgryph, and made it the symbol of his rule and the guardian of his family line. He wrestled the giants that once populated the mountains north of Dace. He faced the ferocious centaurs of the plains. He led his troops across the intensely heated sands of the Wastes. He carved out a home, subjugating errant peoples and subduing monstrous beasts to establish a Kingdom of strength and security. 
		<br><br>
		He led his soldiers into the south, where magic ran rampant. He colonized those lands, turning his kingdom in an empire. In so doing, he became the only ruler to have ever controlled half of TWE's landmass. 
		<br><br>
		In all the myths, King Henthan is an inhumanly powerful and heroic figure. Which of these stories are true and which are false may lie in doubt, but some things are undeniable. The Golden Gilgryph still guards his line, a line that has produced ruler after ruler who excelled at some combination of strength, prudence, and charismatic leadership.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="">Over the Years </a></b>
		<br> Enthan evolved over time, but it never lost sight of the values that founded it. Each ruler in Henthan's line took on the name of Henthan, be they man or woman. Each Henthan reinforced the walls, strengthened the guards, regimented the patrols, cracked down on monsters, and perpetuated the original Henthan's suspicion of arcane and occult magicks.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="">Areth </a></b>
		<br> The Eastern Province, the proud Arethian Empire.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="">Gruss </a></b>
		<br> The Northern Province, the lands of the fearsome Grussian Tribes.
