	<p class="top-text"> <b class="subheader"> The Empire of Enthan </b>
	<br>
	<br><br>
	The Enthan Empire is the Roman-inspired Western Province, an orderly and efficient land ruled by a line of emperors descended from the mythical King Henthan.
	<br>
	<br>
	This page gives a basic overview of the Enthan Province, including its history, structure, priorities, prime exports, religions, geography, cities, culture, traditions, and political relations.

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> History</b>
	<br> 
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Founding</a> </b>
		<br> The legends of King Henthan are many, but few historians dare to try and separate fact from fiction. It is known that he existed, that great warrior of myth who, seeking a stable country where peace and order were plentiful, took up arms to beat back the chaos and establish the thriving city of Great Enthan on the plains of the province that would one day bear his name.
		<br><br>
		The legends speak of incredible acts of power, wit, and wisdom. He tamed the greatest of the Gilgryphs, the immortal Golden Gilgryph, and made it the symbol of his rule and the guardian of his family line. He wrestled the giants that once populated the mountains north of Dace. He faced the ferocious centaurs of the plains. He led his troops across the intensely heated sands of the Wastes. He carved out a home, subjugating errant peoples and subduing monstrous beasts to establish a Kingdom of strength and security. 
		<br><br>
		He led his soldiers into the south, where magic ran rampant. He colonized those lands, turning his kingdom in an empire. In so doing, he became the only ruler to have ever controlled half of TWE's landmass. 
		<br><br>
		In all the myths, King Henthan is an inhumanly powerful and heroic figure. Which of these stories are true and which are false may lie in doubt, but some things are undeniable. The Golden Gilgryph still guards his line, a line that has produced ruler after ruler who excelled at some combination of strength, prudence, and charismatic leadership.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Over the Years </a></b>
		<br> Enthan evolved over time, but it never lost sight of the values that founded it. Each ruler in Henthan's line took on the name of Henthan, be they man or woman. Each Henthan reinforced the walls, strengthened the guards, regimented the patrols, cracked down on monsters, and perpetuated the original Henthan's suspicion of arcane and occult magicks.
		<br><br> Enthan suffered the loss of the southern Province, the land that would become the Tarian Alliance, but over time those wounds would heal. Enthan's borders grew stronger and hardier, her knights stronger and her defnesive formations nigh unbreakable. She turned her attention inward, leaving her lust for conquest behind as she sought to nourish and protect that which she already had. 
		<br><br> In time, each new Henthan became less warlike than the last. They pioneered trade, sought the blessings of their gods, constructed great wonders of architecture, expanded Enthan culture through sport, art, and song. The Golden Gilgryph still protected the King's line, but it slowly became a ceremonial and symbolic beast more so than the destructive force it once was. 

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Provincial Relationships </a></b>
		<br> The Enthan Empire has a strong relationship to the Tarian Alliance to the south. Once they were at war, that much is true, but those days are long gone. The two Provinces now thrive on trade and collaboration. Enthan provides a steady stream of reliable goods and eager buyers for Taria's strange and eclectic wares. Their border is strong, not because Enthan fears a Tarian attack, but because it serves as a reminder of Enthan's commitment to leaving Taria alone.
		<br><br>The tribes of Gruss are not known for positive relationships. They hardly get along with each other, let alone outsiders. However, the westernmost tribe known as Novali has taken a more civilized turn in recent years. Permanent settlements have been established in Novali territory and one such settlement is a port. Novali does some trade with Enthan and their border is a peaceful one. Hopes are high that these sentiments only grow as the generations roll on.
		<br><br> Areth, the empire across the sea, is in many ways the sworn enemy of Enthan. The two behemoths have eyed each other from across the inner sea for generations, each desiring to take the other and prove themselves the greatest. This has, of course, never happened. Gruss in the north and Taria in the south keep these two empires from truly clashing. Neither are eager to attempt a naval invasion, not when the only island left is opposed to such war and is populated by the most skilled sailors in That Which Exists. For now, the two empires can do nothing but glare, posture, and scheme.
		<br><br> The island of Chet'Tun is closest geographically to Enthan. This has led to a strong trade between them in the past, though the 100 years of isolationist war that raged on Chet'Tun ended that. With the newly united Kun'Achi tribe finally at peace, trade has begun again. The people of the island appeared in Enthan's darkest day, fighting alongside Enthan's newest Emperor, Arden, on the Day the Earth Shook. Because of this, relations between Enthan and the island have never been stronger.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Enthan Today </a></b>
		<br> Currently, the land of Enthan is experiencing unrest. 
		<br><br> The Day the Earth Shook was not very long ago, and the effects of that day on the military and the people are still profound. The Darkers have moved into Great Enthan as their new homes, spreading out to other regions of Enthan in search of new places to live and new experiences to discover. The people live in paranoia, questioning all that they don't understand and viewing it as potentially dangerous after seeing the devastation and pain brought by the seemingly innocuous Olivia Bifelgos. 
		<br><br> The Question of War is on everyone's lips. With Areth's recent failed invasion of Taria, fear of Arethian conquest has been heightened. Taria's defenses were successful, but renewed Arethian aggression could easily lead to the eastern empire occupying the south. Two of their 4 gods have been dethroned and their capital city-state has been destroyed. The people of Enthan are left with a dilemma. Do they wait, letting Areth potentially take Taria and its resources, using them to launch an assault on the recently weakened Enthan? Do they strike first, taking Taria for themselves so as to stop Areth from progressing any further? Do they try and extend aid to Taria in the hopes that it will be enough to stave off the Arethians? 
		<br><br> The people are split, each individual feeling strongly. Fear breeds anxiety and anxiety breeds conflict. Conflict intensifies fear. The newly crowned Emperor Arden has yet to release an official decree, leaving his people unsure of their national future for the first time in generations.

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Religion </b>
	<br> 
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="">Pantheon </a></b>
		<br> The Western Empire is a highly religious entity, serving 4 gods who are glorified for their parts in the empire's storied past.
		<br><br> The primary god of Enthan is Vulcan, the god of flame. His shrine is located in Great Enthan
		<br> Those who worship Vulcan often do so because he is seen as the lord over the other Enthan gods. He is believed to be the reason for the deep drive, passion, and ingenuity responsible for Enthan's flourishing civilization.
		<br><br> The secondary god of Enthan is Nike, the goddess of victory. Her shrine is located in Great Enthan. 
		<br> She is often worshiped out of gratefulness for her blessings on the Enthan Empire. The empire has won many battles to get where she is, and Nike is believed to be the reason for that. It is common belief that, as long as she is pleased, no foe could bring about the downfall of Enthan.
		<br><br> The people's god of Enthan is Mercury, the god of travel. His shrine is located south of Port Thargas, at the mouth of the primary pass through the Entho-Tarian mountain range.
		<br> Mercury is revered more personally by the common people of Enthan. His followers are often seen on the roads, protecting travelers from monsters and bandits. They are warm, friendly, and benevolent. He is not seen as nationally necessary, not like Vulcan or Nike, but the people love him and the work they see his followers doing every day. 
		<br><br> The fringe god of Enthan is Saturn, the god of time. His shrine is located north of Thyllia, atop the cliffs overlooking the outer sea to the west.
		<br> Few and far between are those who truly understand and worship Saturn. His shrine is far north and rarely visited. His motives are unclear and his work not often seen. Many think he busies himself with recording histories. Others think he silently manipulates the future to ensure continued prosperity. All revere Saturn in word, but they do not know much of the god they claim allegiance to. Some think he is the most powerful god of them all, though no stories are told among the people to explain exactly why.

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Cities </b>
		<br> 
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="">Great Enthan</a> </b>
		<br> The capitol city of Enthan is one of the two largest cities in That Which Exists. It sits on the Great Plains in central Enthan, and is the seat of power of the Emperor, the primary god Vulcan, and the secondary god Nike. 

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="">Port Eyre</a> </b>
		<br> The northern and primary port of Enthan, a rich city full of powerful aristocrats and influential Houses. 

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="">Thyllia</a> </b>
		<br> The somewhat enigmatic Fortress of Stone, a fortress city with a militant history and resilient populace that sits higher than all other Enthan cities on the rockey northwest ridge of the province. The Shrine of Saturn is not far from here.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="">Port Thargas</a> </b>
		<br> The southern and smaller port town of Enthan, a simple town that does modest trade and sees modest returns. Positioned between the Great Plains and the Entho-Tarian mountain range, nearest to the Shrine of Mercury.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="">Dace</a> </b>
		<br> A town far to the north, by the Grussian border. It used to be a place to send the scum of the Empire, but has begun to be reformed in recent years following its destruction.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="">Endan Village</a> </b>
		<br> A small, quaint village south of the Entho-Tarian mountain range. It sits in largely untouched forest, rich in resources and beasts alike.
