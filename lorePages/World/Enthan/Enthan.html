	<p class="top-text"> <b class="subheader"> The Empire of Enthan </b>
	<br>
	<br><br>
	The Enthan Empire is the Roman-inspired Western Province, an orderly and efficient land ruled by a line of emperors descended from the mythical King Henthan.
	<br>
	<br>
	This page gives a basic overview of the Enthan Province, including its history, structure, priorities, prime exports, religions, geography, cities, culture, traditions, and political relations.

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> History</b>
	<br> 
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="">Founding</a> </b>
		<br> The legends of King Henthan are many, but few historians dare to try and separate fact from fiction. It is known that he existed, that great warrior of myth who, seeking a stable country where peace and order were plentiful, took up arms to beat back the chaos and establish the thriving city of Great Enthan on the plains of the province that would one day bear his name.
		<br><br>
		The legends speak of incredible acts of power, wit, and wisdom. He tamed the greatest of the Gilgryphs, the immortal Golden Gilgryph, and made it the symbol of his rule and the guardian of his family line. He wrestled the giants that once populated the mountains north of Dace. He faced the ferocious centaurs of the plains. He led his troops across the intensely heated sands of the Wastes. He carved out a home, subjugating errant peoples and subduing monstrous beasts to establish a Kingdom of strength and security. 
		<br><br>
		He led his soldiers into the south, where magic ran rampant. He colonized those lands, turning his kingdom in an empire. In so doing, he became the only ruler to have ever controlled half of TWE's landmass. 
		<br><br>
		In all the myths, King Henthan is an inhumanly powerful and heroic figure. Which of these stories are true and which are false may lie in doubt, but some things are undeniable. The Golden Gilgryph still guards his line, a line that has produced ruler after ruler who excelled at some combination of strength, prudence, and charismatic leadership.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="">Over the Years </a></b>
		<br> Enthan evolved over time, but it never lost sight of the values that founded it. Each ruler in Henthan's line took on the name of Henthan, be they man or woman. Each Henthan reinforced the walls, strengthened the guards, regimented the patrols, cracked down on monsters, and perpetuated the original Henthan's suspicion of arcane and occult magicks.
		<br><br> Enthan suffered the loss of the southern Province, the land that would become the Tarian Alliance, but over time those wounds would heal. Enthan's borders grew stronger and hardier, her knights stronger and her defnesive formations nigh unbreakable. She turned her attention inward, leaving her lust for conquest behind as she sought to nourish and protect that which she already had. 
		<br><br> In time, each new Henthan became less warlike than the last. They pioneered trade, sought the blessings of their gods, constructed great wonders of architecture, expanded Enthan culture through sport, art, and song. The Golden Gilgryph still protected the King's line, but it slowly became a ceremonial and symbolic beast more so than the destructive force it once was. 

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="">Provincial Relationships </a></b>
		<br> The Enthan Empire has a strong relationship to the Tarian Alliance to the south. Once they were at war, that much is true, but those days are long gone. The two Provinces now thrive on trade and collaboration. Enthan provides a steady stream of reliable goods and eager buyers for Taria's strange and eclectic wares. Their border is strong, not because Enthan fears a Tarian attack, but because it serves as a reminder of Enthan's commitment to leaving Taria alone.
		<br><br>The tribes of Gruss are not known for positive relationships. They hardly get along with each other, let alone outsiders. However, the westernmost tribe known as Novali has taken a more civilized turn in recent years. Permanent settlements have been established in Novali territory and one such settlement is a port. Novali does some trade with Enthan and their border is a peaceful one. Hopes are high that these sentiments only grow as the generations roll on.
		<br><br> Areth, the empire across the sea, is in many ways the sworn enemy of Enthan. The two behemoths have eyed each other from across the inner sea for generations, each desiring to take the other and prove themselves the greatest. This has, of course, never happened. Gruss in the north and Taria in the south keep these two empires from truly clashing. Neither are eager to attempt a naval invasion, not when the only island left is opposed to such war and is populated by the most skilled sailors in That Which Exists. For now, the two empires can do nothing but glare, posture, and scheme.
		<br><br> The island of Chet'Tun is closest geographically to Enthan. This has led to a strong trade between them in the past, though the 100 years of isolationist war that raged on Chet'Tun ended that. With the newly united Kun'Achi tribe finally at peace, trade has begun again. The people of the island appeared in Enthan's darkest day, fighting alongside Enthan's newest Emperor, Arden, on the Day the Earth Shook. Because of this, relations between Enthan and the island have never been stronger.
