	Greetings Conspirator
	<br>
	<br>
	You have found your way to this page because you are one of only 3 people I can trust.
	<br>
	There is a secret I need you to crack. I am currently indisposed and I cannot do it myself. They would recognize me too quickly.
	<br>
	That's where you come in.
	<br> 
	This is as close as I can get. From here, you will be on your own. It's up to you to find the Secret Terminal and find the data within.
	<br>
	They told me it didn't exist. They told me I was crazy. I may never be able to prove them wrong, but I don't have to. 
	<br>
	You can do it. 
	<br> 
	You can find the secret pages they don't want us to know about.
	<br>
	I have to entrust this task to you. There is no one else I can trust.
	<br>
	Thankfully, you are not alone. I encourage you to reach out to your fellow conspirators. I have written their real names here. It is a risk, I know, but it is too important that you know each other. Work together. You'll need friends if you want to crack this conspiracy open.

	As I said, this is the closest I can get. However, I am confident that, together, you have all the tools you need to find the Secret Terminal and gain access to the hidden files.
	<br>
	<br>
	Good luck
	<br>
