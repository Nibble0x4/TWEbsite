	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> The Grusslings have been around for a long time. How long, exactly, is unknown. However, their origins have been surmised to be as descendants of the great giants of Gruss. The Grussian Half-Giants, a strange race that seems to bridge the gap between human and giant, is assumed to be the origin of the Grusslings. While Grusslings were sometimes called Grussian Quarter-Giants, most dropped that name when it became clear that the concentration of giant blood in their veins was not decreasing with time. Somehow, this was a race all of its own.


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> The Grusslings embody the pinnacle of Grussian values. They are huge, standing an average of a foot taller than even the tallest Grussian, and their eyes reflect the tundra in which they dwell. Their eyes, at first glance, appear to be blank. However, closer inspection reveals that their retinas have simply dimmed in color. Typically pale white or perhaps light blue or green, the eyes of a Grussling see with a discerning gaze, despite their blind appearance. Their hair grows in thicker strands, lending itself to a more monstrous appearance and locks or braids that don’t appear entirely separate from solid rope. Their skin is tough, hardened by the environment and resilient to the cold. However, outside of these differences, the Grusslings appear similar to any other Grussian. The exception to this rule is the Greater Grusslings. They exist as a subset of the Grusslings that have more in common with their giant ancestors. These beings dwarf even their fellow Grusslings, and have been known to be as volatile as the beasts themselves.


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> The Grusslings aren’t the most common race in Gruss, but they aren’t rare either. In most cases, they live alongside their Grussian brethren and are considered to be equals. However, their prowess on the battlefield and notably different appearance serve as a clear indicator that the Grusslings are not the same as the humans around them. The only place they aren’t often found is in the territory of the Novali. It is said that the very lifeblood of Gruss itself flows through its children, and the Grusslings staunchly believe that spoiling the wild nature of the province is to spit on the very land which gives them life. Thus, the consistently more civilized culture of the Novali tribe is distasteful to them.

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> These are the basic traits natural to Grusslings. Many of these will have differing options depending on whether your Fearthite is male or female.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>
		<br> The Grusslings are physically superior, but refuse to advance in intellect beyond their origins. They gain a +2 racial bonus to strength and constitution, but a -2 racial penalty to intelligence.
		<br><br> <u>Greater:</u>  They gain a +4 racial bonus to strength and constitution. But they also gain a -4 racial penalty to intelligence and wisdom.


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Base Speed </b>
		<br> A Grussling’s base speed is 30 feet.
		<br> <u>Greater:</u>  40 feet

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>
		<br> The Grusslings are medium creatures and thus gain no penalties or bonuses from their size.
		<br> <u>Greater:</u>  The Greater Grusslings are large creatures, gaining a -1 penalty to attack rolls and ac, but a +1 bonus to CMB and CMD

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Grusslings are humanoids with the giant subtype.
		<br><br> <u>Greater:</u>  Gain the magical beast and monstrous humanoid subtypes.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Defense Racial Traits </b>
		<br> The skin of a Grussling more closely resembles hide than human skin. They gain a +1 natural armor bonus.
		<br> Grusslings are resilient to the harsh northern climate of their home. They gain cold resistance 1 per every 4 character levels.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Skill Traits </b>
		<br> Grusslings are skilled and terrifying people of the wilderness, and gain a +2 racial bonus on survival checks and intimidate.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Sense Traits </b>
		<br> The Grusslings are prepared to hunt, even at night. They have low-light vision for 60 feet.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Monstrous Traits </b>
		<br> These traits are attributed solely to Greater Grusslings, and they cannot be dropped or swapped.
		<br><br><u>Male Only:</u> Greater Grusslings only ever enter the world as males, and are sterile.
		<br><br><u>Survival Rage:</u>When he drops to 30% hp, and again for every iteration of damage he takes while below it, he must roll a percent. If this activates, then he enters rage as per the barbarian class feature and attacks all creatures within range, regardless of affinity. In addition, any attempts to heal him from another creature provokes an attack of opportunity that he must take, even if he has no remaining attacks of opportunity. These effects stack with existing rage. If a raging barbarian enters this state, they lose control completely until they rest.
		<br><br><u>Weapon Specialty:</u> The Greater Grusslings are large and powerful, but brutal. This extends to their weapons as well, as their lack of care tends to break their weapons rather easily. Thus, they are only proficient in the use of weapons large enough for them. If they attempt to use a weapon not specially designed for them, they risk breaking it every time they attack.
		<br><br> <u>Unrestrained Violence:</u>  To the Greater Grusslings, violence is as natural as breathing. When they lose control of themselves, whether due to magical effects or Survival rage, they ignore the -5 penalty for multiple attacks.
