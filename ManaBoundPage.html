	<p class="text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> The ManaBound </b>
	<br> In TWE, there exists a type of warrior that dedicates their life to the pursuit of raw, destructive power. These people embrace magic as the ultimate source of power, but refuse to spend their days locked in a tower, studying spells while their bodies waste away. Instead, these people become students of Mana. In the Tri-Villages of Taria, an entire village known as Werta is devoted to the mastery of this special brand of magic. Students of Mana learn to call upon the power of the world around them without losing the chance to train their bodies physically. They become bound to Mana, and they wield it alongside their bodies to inflict maximum destruction.

	<br><br><b>Role</b>: The Manabound are a combat-centric class. They are decently effective fist fighters with the toughness to go toe-to-toe with melee warriors, but their main draw is the mana they can use to cast their special elemental spells, called Tacs. They regenerate a little mana each round, so they can feel free to throw out attacks without worrying about spell slots or any such silliness.

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Class Features </b>
	<br> 
	<br><br> 

		<hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader">Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>
		<br> A Manabound is proficient with no weapons and with light armor, though they still do take the arcane Tac failure chance for wearing armor. See weapon lists <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons#simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons">HERE</a>. See Armor lists <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/armor">HERE</a>.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Bound to Mana </b>
		<br> A Manabound performs a ritual at level 1 that Tacs them irreversibly to Mana, a combination of aether and human energy. This ritual gives them the ability to harness mana, but locks them out of ever forming a connection with another kind of magic. Manabound cannot take levels in other magical classes, unless they give up all magic abilities from that class. Similarly, anyone who becomes Manabound loses all magical abilities and spells they have gained from other classes or even their race.
		<br><br>
		In return, the power of mana fills them, providing an overflowing fountain of renewing magical energy that they can wield at will.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> ManaFist Destiny </b>
		<br> The Manabound are Tac-casters, wielders of magic, but they are not the kind to shy away from danger. To the contrary, Manabound are trained specifically in the use of their bodies as weapons, eschewing other kinds of weapons and relying on their own strength. As a result, Manabound are never truly unarmed even if they run out of mana.
		<br><br>
		At first level, the Manabound gains the Improved Unarmed Strike feat. In addition, they are considered to have proficiency with no other weapons and their Manabound Base Attack Bonus is considered to be ½ of their Manabound level when wielding any such weapons.
		<br><br>
		In addition, the Manabound learns the basic Tac from each element. See the “Tac List” section to find them.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Mana Pool </b>
		<br> The Manabound gains a pool of mana at first level. This pool contains a number of points equal to their charisma modifier. 
		<br><br> This pool is the source of their magic, and refills automatically. Every 6 seconds, the Manabound gains 1 point of mana in their pool. In addition, they can spend a single action on their turn to regain 1 point of mana.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Tacs </b>
		<br> Manabound have a rather restricted Tac list, the result of wielding such unrestricted magic. They gain a small number of Tacs as they grow stronger, so their choices of Tac matter greatly. 
		<br><br>
		At every even level, a Manabound mage learns 1 new Tac and each known Tac gains 1 rank. A new Tac learned can be used at will, provided the mage has enough mana to cast it. New Tacs learned are learned at Tac rank equal to your mage rank.
		<br><br>
		A Tac rank is essentially a power boost to a learned Tac that shows how much more skilled a mage has become at wielding their magic. Each Tac has a listed “Rankup Effect” (see the “Tac List” section for examples) that takes effect every time a Tac receives a rankup. 
		<br><br>
		Not every Tac in the Manabound list utilizes a DC, but here is the calculation for DCs.
		<br><b> Tac DC = 8 + charisma modifier</b>
		<br><br><i>Detached:</i> This paragraph contains rules that apply ONLY to Detached mages. When a Detached mage learns a new Tac, they are not restricted to choosing Tacs from any particular elements. In addition, the new Tacs they learn are learned at Tac rank 1.
		<br><br> See the “Tac List” for reference on the Manabound Tacs.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Elemental Attunement </b>
		<div class="classFeature">
			<br> Each Manabound wields the power of the elements, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have favorites. As they grow in power and experience, the Manabound has a choice to attune themselves to different elements. When they do so, they become stronger in the use of their chosen element but unable to use any others. 
			<br><br> 
			When a Manabound mage chooses an attunement, they lose all of the basic Tacs from elements not included within their attunements. The basic Tacs of their remaining elements are boosted one rank. From that point on, mages can only select Tacs from within their attunement. 

			<br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Passion- Fire/Force</b>
			<br> Fire is rampant and destructive, with little restraint. Fire Tacs focus on destroying their target and anything else that happens to be nearby with ferocity and burning power. 
			<br>
			Force is an oft-overlooked element, but is the truest weapon that mana can produce. Force Tacs focus on striking their target regardless of protection, even if that comes at the cost of power. 
			<br>
			Mages choosing this attunement tend to be fierce and confident, taking down hordes and individuals without breaking a sweat.
			<br><br> You can find a Tac List with the Passion Tacs <a href="ManaBoundTacListPassion.html">HERE</a>.

			<br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Serenity- Water/Ice</b>
			<br> Water is beautiful but deceptively strong, and water Tacs focus on pushing and pulling friends and foes around the battle, keeping enemies constantly off-balance. 
			<br>
			Ice is similar to water in its beauty, but is far more severe in its methods. Ice Tacs focus on wearing down opponents, slowing them, weakening them, and stealing their will to fight. 
			<br>
			Mages choosing this attunement tend to be patient and calm, but severe, always in control.

			<br><br><b class="earthSubHeader">Patience- Earth/Acid</b>
			<br> Earth is strong and unyielding, giving way to nothing. Earth Tacs are powerful when they strike, crushing their targets under unforgiving stone attacks. 
			<br>
			Acid is the bane of earth, causing all defenses to crumble under its touch. Acid Tacs focus on breaking down the resistance of its targets before it allows them to finally die.  
			<br>
			Mages choosing this attunement tend to be firm and unyielding, planning out the best time to strike.
			<br><br> You can find a Tac List with the Patience Tacs <a href="ManaBoundTacListPatience.html">HERE</a>.

			<br><br><b class="windSubHeader">Decision- Wind/Electricity</b>
			<br> Wind is swift and evasive, moving wherever it wishes with little thought or worry of being stopped. Wind Tacs emphasize speed and movement, especially when attacking.  
			<br>
			Lightning is the perfect complement of wind, arcing through the air to strike down its foes. Lightning Tacs focus on dealing high damage to creatures below them and even occasionally arcing between targets. 
			<br>
			Mages choosing this attunement tend to be quick in mind and body, surprising their foes and keeping them on their toes.

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Detached</b>
			<br> Any mage who chooses this option eschews the power offered by the individual elements, instead choosing not to give up any of their basic Tacs. 
			<br>
			These mages gain no Exclusive Tacs from their attunement, as they have not attuned to anything, but instead have different rules governing Tac selection (see the “Tacs” section). 
			<br>
			Mages choosing to remain detached tend to be individualistic and clever, using creative tactics to solve problems in ways that no attuned mage ever could.

		</div>

		
		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Tac List </b>
			<br> All Tacs are classified based on their element. Some Tacs are listed as derivatives of other Tacs. In this case, the source Tac must be known before any of the following Tacs can be known.

			<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="fireHeader"> Fire Tacs </b>
			<br> 
		<div class="classFeature">
			<br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Fire Punch- [ 1 Mana ] [ BASIC ]</b>
			<br> Strike your foes with flame balled in your fist.
			<br>
			If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 + 1 fire damage. If the attack is a crit or soft crit, then the target and any chosen creatures within 20 feet of the target are Inflamed 2. Creatures set aflame this way take 1d4 + 2 damage now and at the start of their turn until they dowse themselves
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 fire damage, and increase Inflamed by 2.

			<br><br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Explode- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Release an explosion of flame in all directions, searing all creatures within range, unless you restrain it.
			<br>
			All creatures within a 10-foot radius burst must make a reflex save or else take 2d6 + 1 fire damage. If you would like to exclude certain creatures within the range, then the damage is halved. Any creature who makes the save halves the damage.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 to the DC and 1d6 + 1 to the damage

			<br><br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Fire Blast- [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Strike your foe and unleash a blast of flame that strikes at those nearby.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as a part of an unarmed strike. Regardless of whether the attack hits your initial target, compare the attack roll to the AC of the target and every other creature in a 20 foot cone. Anyone hit is dealt 1d6 + 1 fire damage. If any of these creatures are crit or soft crit by this Tac, then all creatures hit by the attack are Inflamed 2, taking damage now and at the start of their turn until they dowse themselves.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 fire damage, and increase Inflamed by 2.

			<br><br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Fire Jet- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Strike and eject flame forcefully from the point of contact, burning your foe and launching yourself backward.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as a part of an unarmed strike, though there need not be a target. If you strike a foe, then you deal 1d6 + 1 fire damage. Regardless, you are launched in the opposite direction 15 feet. This Tac can be used to reduce fall damage.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 fire damage

			<br><br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Fireball- [ 5 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Conjure a great 20 ft-radius orb of flame and hurl it through the air at your enemies.
			<br>
			Hurl the fireball at any spot within 45 feet. The moment it strikes something, it detonates and all creatures within 20 feet of it must make reflex save to halve 2d6 + 2 fire damage.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 to the DC and 1d6 + 2 fire damage

			<br><br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Burn- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Take a deep breath and imbue your strikes with flame.
			<br>
			For 1 turn, anyone struck by your fists is Inflamed 2, taking the burn damage now and at the start of their next turn. This Tac takes an action to cast, but can be sustained in the next turn and any consecutive turns as a free action by spending the appropriate Mana cost.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: increase Inflamed by 2.

			<br><br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Firefoot- [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Wreathe your feet in fire and run forth, scorching the ground behind you. 
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as a part of a move action. Wherever you step for the duration of the move, the surface beneath you is set aflame for 1 round. Any creatures who step into this flame take 1d6 + 1 points of fire damage and are Inflamed 2, taking damage then and at the start of their turn until they dowse themselves. The fire can be bypassed by leaping over it with an acrobatics check with DC 14. You cannot run through another player’s space using this Tac unless you succeed on an Overrun maneuver.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: increase Inflamed by 2 and the acrobatics DC by 1

			<br><br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Fire Shield- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Cast flame over a creature you can reach, wrapping them in warmth and protection.
			<br>
			For 1 round, the creature halves damage from fire and cold attacks made against them, and deals 2 fire damage whenever they make contact with another creature. This Tac takes an action to cast, but can be maintained each round 
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase fire damage by 1

			<br><br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Bonfire- [ 6 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Summon forth flame from beneath you, billowing up and around you to consume all adjacent foes.
			<br>
			All creatures adjacent to you must make a reflex save to halve 1d6 + 1 fire damage. This fire damage is multiplied by the number of adjacent creatures (so if you are surrounded by 8 creatures it becomes 8d6 + 8). 
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase DC by 1 and damage (before multiplier) by 1d6+1

			<br><br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Heat Aura- [ 2 Mana ] [ EXCLUSIVE ]</b>
			<br> Focus and extend the scorching heat of your flame in all directions, intensifying the heat of your surroundings for 1 round.
			<br>
			All creatures within 20 feet of you are weakened, giving them weakness to fire (or removing resistance, if it is there), halving the power of ice effects, and melting ice structures. This Tac can be cast as an action, or cast as a part of another fire Tac. This Tac can only be cast once per round.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: This Tac cannot be ranked up

		</div>


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="waterHeader"> Water Tacs </b>
			<br> 
		<div class="classFeature">
			<br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Water Slap [ 1 Mana ] [ BASIC ]</b>
			<br> Smack a target with the force of a small wave.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as part of an unarmed strike. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 + 1 bludgeoning damage and the target is pushed 5 feet. If they are obstructed, they instead take an additional 1 bludgeoning damage.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 bludgeoning damage to the initial strike and the additional damage for being pushed into an obstruction.

			<br><br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Wave Kick- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Kick forward, sending a wave pushing forward, bulrushing creatures caught.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as a part of an unarmed strike. The wave moves 20 feet in the direction you kick, moving along the ground until it hits an obstruction or a lack of ground.  Make a CMB check against the CMD of every creature the wave meets. If it is higher, then the wave pushes those creatures until the end of its movement. Any creature slammed into a wall or another creature takes 1d6 + 1 bludgeoning damage for each such slam. 
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Add 1 to the CMB and 1 to the damage, and 5 foot to the distance.

			<br><br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Dam The River- [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Calm your breathing and focus on the water around you, priming it to move at a moment’s notice.
			<br>
			For 1 turn, any water Tac you cast pushes 10 extra feet and deals an additional 2 damage on hit and on each collision. This Tac takes an action to cast initially, but can be maintained as a free action each turn by spending the Mana cost.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: increase the damage by 2

			<br><br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Geyser Stomp- [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Stomp the earth, sending water below, then summon it back out with a mighty geyser.
			<br>
			Pick a space within reach for the geyser to come from. Any creature in this space must succeed at a reflex save to halve 1d6 + 2 bludgeoning damage. If they fail the save, they are launched up to 15 feet upward and fall back in their own square or any adjacent square of your choice, taking the appropriate fall damage. If there is a prone creature adjacent to you, you may choose to cast this as part of an unarmed strike against them. If you do, they get no save and this Tac’s damage is multiplied on a critical hit. If you use this Tac on yourself, you take no damage and may reduce the height of the geyser as you desire.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: increase the DC by 1, the distance by 5 feet, and the damage by 2

			<br><br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Hydro Cannon- [ 4 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Summon forth a tube of water, pressurizing it until it breaks loose and fires at your opponents.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as a part of an unarmed strike. If it hits, then they take 2d6 + 2 bludgeoning damage and you must make a CMB check to bulrush. If that is successful, they are launched 10 feet backwards. If they strike a creature or solid surface, Both creatures take that same damage again. 
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: increase the distance by 10 feet and the damage by 2

			<br><br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Rough Tide- [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Raise your arms and let the waters follow suit.
			<br>
			If you are on dry ground, the area within 30 feet of you becomes waterlogged and is considered difficult terrain for 1 round. If a body of water is within the area, it becomes violent and attempts to drown anyone small enough in its area. The Swim DC to avoid being held under the water is 14. This Tac takes an action to cast, but can be maintained as a free action next turn by spending the Mana cost. 
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: increase the DC by 1

			<br><br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Ocean Mist- [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Summon forth water from all around you, forming a mist in the area and drenching everything.
			<br>
			For 1 round, the area within 10 feet of you is covered in a wet mist. The mist does not obscure vision, but clings to creatures within its area. This enables invisible creatures to be seen and fires to be dowsed. Any creatures made of fire in the area take 1d6 + 1 damage. 
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: increase the radius by 5 feet, and the damage by 1d6+1.

			<br><br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Prehensile Cohesion- [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Focus water around your arms, using surface tension to form tubes of coagulated water that can flail about on your command.
			<br>
			This Tac takes an action to cast, and grants + 5 foot reach to unarmed attacks. In addition, All water Tacs cast as a part of an unarmed strike while you are under the effects of Prehensile Cohesion are treated as if they are 1 rank higher. This Tac can be maintained next round as a free action by spending the mana cost.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: increase the reach bonus by 5 feet.

			<br><br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Cyclone Push- [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Pull water around you in a ring, then expand it outward rapidly, slamming foes away.
			<br>
			This Tac takes an action to cast. All creatures within your reach must make a fortitude save or be pushed 10 feet. If they are pushed into an obstruction or a creature, they and the obstruction take damage equal to your unarmed strike + 2.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the collision damage by 2, the push distance by 5, and the DC by 1

			<br><br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Ride the Waves- [ 0 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Level your breathing and cause the water to do the same.
