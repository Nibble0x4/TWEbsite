	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Materials </b>
	<br> That Which Exists is full of powerful weapons, stout armors, and curious items. What happens, however, when these things are damaged?
	<br><br> Like characters, items have HP and AC. These function similarly to character HP and AC, with the following differences:
	<ol >
		<li>Items cannot be healed by healing spells or hurt by most effects the way people are. Most attacks, unless they are Sunder maneuver or specifically noted to do damage to items, do not harm weapons, armor, or items.</li>
		<li>Items can be repaired by a craftsman or some spells designed to heal items.</li>
		<li>An unattended item has an AC of 10. An attended item's AC is ignored and replaced with the CMD of the one attending it. It must then be targeted using a Sunder maneuver. </li>
		<li>Items also possess a Hardness value. This hardness functions as DR/- that is subtracted from all incoming damage before it applies to the HP of the item.</li>
		<li>When items are reduced to 0 HP, they gain the Broken condition. If they are reduced to an amount of negative HP equal to their max HP, they are completely destroyed.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p class="class-description">
	<br><br>- The Broken condition renders the item useless, removing any armor bonuses from armor, turning any weapon into an improvised weapon, and negating any helpful special abilities tied to them. Each item differs when it is broken, but it is never good.
	
	<br><br>

	<br><br> On this page you will find a collection of materials that exist in TWE and can be used to make weapons, armor, and items. 
	<br> The materials used for an item change the Hardness, HP, and AC of the item in question. They can also sometimes grant strange effects to any items made of them.
	<br><br> <a href="../randomTables/itemBaseHpTable.html">HERE</a> you will find a helpful reference table for the standard HP of regular armor, weapons, and shields.
