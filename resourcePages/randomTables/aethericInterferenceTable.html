	<br> This is a table that can be rolled upon for several reasons. However, chances are, they are bad! 
	<br>The most likely reason for rolling on this table is: 
	<br>You tried casting a spell and, whether due to armor interference, enemy inferference, or good old fashioned panic, you messed it up!

	<br><br> I hope this goes well for you, but it isn't likely to... Good luck! ~ Nibble

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>CRAP!</td>
				<td>All your magic explodes outward. Count up the levels of every spell slot you have remaining for today. You deal that many d4 damage to yourself and everyone within 10 feet of you.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>2-5</td>
				<td>Uh Oh!</td>
				<td>Your spell twists into the fabric of time and expands, freezing you in time for your next 1d4 turns. You are considered helpless until the effects wear off.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>6-10</td>
				<td>Rookie Mistake</td>
				<td>Your spell explodes in your face, knocking you prone and dealing 1d4 damage per level of the spell to you.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>11-15</td>
				<td>Wrong place!</td>
				<td>Your spell fizzles, personally offending the ground beneath your feet. You are held in place by the ground for your next 1d4 turns. They will grasp you again if you are pulled free. If you are not on the ground when this occurs, you are pulled forcefully downward, doubling fall damage. This negates feather fall.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>16-20</td>
				<td>Shh!</td>
				<td>You lose the spell and it takes your voice with it, leaving you magically silenced for 1d4 turns.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>21-30</td>
				<td>Wrong target!</td>
				<td>If your spell is beneficial, it is cast on a random enemy. If your spell s harmful, it is cast on a random ally.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>31-40</td>
				<td>Wrong time!</td>
				<td>The spell still goes off...eventually. The spell will complete and be cast from your location at a random time.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>41-50</td>
				<td>Do you have a permit for that?</td>
				<td>An aetheric enforcement officer, made of pure force, appears 40 feet away from you and chases you down. He has a movement speed equal to your speed +10 feet. He can burrow through any obstruction with half movement speed. If he reaches you, he apprehends you. He cannot be killed or dispelled unless a strong enough dispel magic is cast on him.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>51-55</td>
				<td>Now, Apologize!</td>
				<td>Teleport and become prone adjacent to the nearest creature who would have been affected by the spell. If the target was you or there was no target, then the target is the nearest non-you creature.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>56-60</td>
				<td>Everyone, look at this loser!</td>
				<td>An incredibly loud sound and light show play over your head and any magical effects you have active are dispelled. </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>61-65</td>
				<td>You aren't even wearing Pants!</td>
				<td>If you are wearing armor, it is stripped from you and your regular clothes are left. Any magical items you wear or wield are also dropped.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>66-70</td>
				<td>I'm going to have to write you up!</td>
				<td>The spell you were going to cast is instead converted to a scroll and magically delivered to the nearest enemy. If there is no enemy nearby, it is sent out into the world, who knows where.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>71-80</td>
				<td>Enunciate!</td>
				<td>Half of the meaning of the spell was lost. Your DM can help you figure out what happens.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>81-90</td>
				<td>Did somebody say Cornelius?</td>
				<td>A small, invulnerable, persistent fairy named Cornelius appears and casts a spell of his own every turn. He is...slightly chaotic.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>91-95</td>
				<td>That's Wild!</td>
				<td>A Wild Dancer appears and performs 1d4 <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/variant-magic-rules/primal-magic/">Wild Wiggles</a>. 
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>96-99</td>
				<td>I cast Fireball!</td>
				<td>Regardless of what you were going to cast, you now cast fireball in the same place you were going to cast the spell you lost. If you were already going to cast Fireball, it becomes Maximized.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>100</td>
				<td>Ohhh, THAT'S what you meant!</td>
				<td>Change or add up to 3 letters to the spell and recast it immediately. The effect must be different than before.</td>
			</tr>
