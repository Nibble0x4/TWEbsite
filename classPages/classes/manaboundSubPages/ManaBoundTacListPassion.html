		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Tac List </b>
			<br> All Tacs are classified based on their element. Some Tacs are listed as derivatives of other Tacs. In this case, the source Tac must be known before any of the following Tacs can be known.

			<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="fireHeader"> Fire Tacs </b>
			<br> 
		<div class="classFeature">
			<br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Fire Punch- [ 1 Mana ] [ BASIC ]</b>
			<br> Strike your foes with flame balled in your fist.
			<br>
			If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 + 1 fire damage. If the attack is a crit or soft crit, then the target and any chosen creatures within 20 feet of the target are Inflamed 2. Creatures set aflame this way take 1d4 + 2 damage now and at the start of their turn until they dowse themselves
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 fire damage, and increase Inflamed by 2.

			<br><br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Explode- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Release an explosion of flame in all directions, searing all creatures within range, unless you restrain it.
			<br>
			All creatures within a 10-foot radius burst must make a reflex save or else take 2d6 + 1 fire damage. If you would like to exclude certain creatures within the range, then the damage is halved. Any creature who makes the save halves the damage.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 to the DC and 1d6 + 1 to the damage

			<br><br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Fire Blast- [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Strike your foe and unleash a blast of flame that strikes at those nearby.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as a part of an unarmed strike. Regardless of whether the attack hits your initial target, compare the attack roll to the AC of the target and every other creature in a 20 foot cone. Anyone hit is dealt 1d6 + 1 fire damage. If any of these creatures are crit or soft crit by this Tac, then all creatures hit by the attack are Inflamed 2, taking damage now and at the start of their turn until they dowse themselves.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 fire damage, and increase Inflamed by 2.

			<br><br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Fire Jet- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Strike and eject flame forcefully from the point of contact, burning your foe and launching yourself backward.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as a part of an unarmed strike, though there need not be a target. If you strike a foe, then you deal 1d6 + 1 fire damage. Regardless, you are launched in the opposite direction 15 feet. This Tac can be used to reduce fall damage.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 fire damage

			<br><br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Fireball- [ 5 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Conjure a great 20 ft-radius orb of flame and hurl it through the air at your enemies.
			<br>
			Hurl the fireball at any spot within 45 feet. The moment it strikes something, it detonates and all creatures within 20 feet of it must make reflex save to halve 2d6 + 2 fire damage.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 to the DC and 1d6 + 2 fire damage

			<br><br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Burn- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Take a deep breath and imbue your strikes with flame.
			<br>
			For 1 turn, anyone struck by your fists is Inflamed 2, taking the burn damage now and at the start of their next turn. This Tac takes an action to cast, but can be sustained in the next turn and any consecutive turns as a free action by spending the appropriate Mana cost.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: increase Inflamed by 2.

			<br><br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Firefoot- [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Wreathe your feet in fire and run forth, scorching the ground behind you. 
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as a part of a move action. Wherever you step for the duration of the move, the surface beneath you is set aflame for 1 round. Any creatures who step into this flame take 1d6 + 1 points of fire damage and are Inflamed 2, taking damage then and at the start of their turn until they dowse themselves. The fire can be bypassed by leaping over it with an acrobatics check with DC 14. You cannot run through another player’s space using this Tac unless you succeed on an Overrun maneuver.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: increase Inflamed by 2 and the acrobatics DC by 1

			<br><br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Fire Shield- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Cast flame over a creature you can reach, wrapping them in warmth and protection.
			<br>
			For 1 round, the creature halves damage from fire and cold attacks made against them, and deals 2 fire damage whenever they make contact with another creature. This Tac takes an action to cast, but can be maintained each round 
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase fire damage by 1

			<br><br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Bonfire- [ 6 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Summon forth flame from beneath you, billowing up and around you to consume all adjacent foes.
			<br>
			All creatures adjacent to you must make a reflex save to halve 1d6 + 1 fire damage. This fire damage is multiplied by the number of adjacent creatures (so if you are surrounded by 8 creatures it becomes 8d6 + 8). 
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase DC by 1 and damage (before multiplier) by 1d6+1

			<br><br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Heat Aura- [ 2 Mana ] [ EXCLUSIVE ]</b>
			<br> Focus and extend the scorching heat of your flame in all directions, intensifying the heat of your surroundings for 1 round.
			<br>
			All creatures within 20 feet of you are weakened, giving them weakness to fire (or removing resistance, if it is there), halving the power of ice effects, and melting ice structures. This Tac can be cast as an action, or cast as a part of another fire Tac. This Tac can only be cast once per round.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: This Tac cannot be ranked up

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="forceHeader"> Force Tacs </b>
			<br> 
		<div class="classFeature">
			<br><br><b class="forceSubHeader">Force Palm [ 1 Mana ] [ BASIC ]</b>
			<br> Focus your mana and strike your foe directly with your palm.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as part of an unarmed strike, but it is a touch attack. If the touch attack hits, it deals 1d6 + 1 force damage.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 force damage

			<br><br><br><b class="forceSubHeader">Gravity Cloak- [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Create and sustain a constant force to follow a creature you touch.
			<br>
			For 1 round, the creature can run or jump onto any solid surface it desires, as the force will reorient itself perpendicular to that surface. The creature can move on these surfaces as if it was the normal ground. In addition, the creature gains a +2 bonus to acrobatics for that turn. This Tac takes an action to cast.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Add +2 to the acrobatics bonus.

			<br><br><br><b class="forceSubHeader">Force Spike- [ 4 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Conjure force to take advantage of your opponent’s armor to crush them. 
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as a part of an unarmed strike. If your strike hits, it deals force damage based on the weight class of its armor. +0 if no armor, +2 if light armor, +4 if medium armor, and +8 if heavy armor. Natural armor is considered to be light armor by default, though different creatures may have heavier natural armor.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>:  Add +2 to the light armor bonus, +4 to the medium armor bonus, and +8 to the heavy armor bonus.

			<br><br><br><b class="forceSubHeader">Force Shot- [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Conjure a ball of force and sling it at a target you can see. 
			<br>
			The orb will travel any path it must in order to reach its target, swerving around and phasing through obstacles until it reaches the target. When it arrives, unless the target has some sort of force-based protection, the attack automatically hits and deals 1d6 + 1 points of force damage.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>:  Add +1 to the force damage.

			<br><br><br><b class="forceSubHeader">Friendly Fling- [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Summon force at the back of a creature you can reach, launching it in a direction of your choice.
			<br>
			 The creature is flung up to 30 feet in that direction, slowing before it makes contact with any surface until the movement is complete, at which point they free fall.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>:  Add 10 feet to the distance

			<br><br><br><b class="forceSubHeader">Forced Float- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Surround your foe with force, pushing them free from gravity’s restraint for 1 turn.
			<br>
			 This Tac can be cast as an action at any creature you can reach. If they fail at a reflex save, they are not affected by gravity for 1 turn, as if they are levitating. You cannot magically control where they go, but any force on them will impact where they go.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>:  Add +1 to the DC 

			<br><br><br><b class="forceSubHeader">Force Shield- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Summon a shield of force to cling to a touched creature for 1 round.
			<br>
			 This shield grants +1 shield bonus to AC and nullifies any force effects that hit automatically on that creature.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>:  +1 to AC

			<br><br><br><b class="forceSubHeader">Force Field- [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Summon a wall of force for 1 round. 
			<br>
			 This wall permits nothing but light to pass through it, not even force effects or incorporeal creatures. Pick a space border within 5 feet of you. You create a square wall that is 5 x 5 feet in dimension. You can create it as a rectangle smaller than this, as long as the total wall fits within a 5 x 5 square. 
			<br> The wall has AC 12 with 10 HP. The whole wall takes damage when attacked, regardless of where it was hit.
			<br> 
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>:  Increase the dimensions by 5 x 5 and increase the hp by 5.

			<br><br><br><b class="forceSubHeader">Forceful Entry- [ 1 Mana ] [ EXCLUSIVE ]</b>
			<br> Temporarily infuse your own body with force, allowing your strikes to pass through objects not made of force as if they were not even there.
			<br>
			 This Tac can be cast as a part of an unarmed strike or as an action, allowing one of your unarmed attacks to be a touch attack. This Tac can only be cast once per round.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>:  This Tac cannot be ranked up.
