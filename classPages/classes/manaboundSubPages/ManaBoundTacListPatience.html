		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Tac List </b>
			<br> All Tacs are classified based on their element. Some Tacs are listed as derivatives of other Tacs. In this case, the source Tac must be known before any of the following Tacs can be known.

					<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="earthHeader"> Earth Tacs </b>
			<br> 
		<div class="classFeature">
			<br><br><b class="earthSubHeader">Earth Headbutt [ 1 Mana ] [ BASIC ]</b>
			<br> Encase your head in a shell of stone and slam your target, breaking the shell.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as part of an unarmed strike. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 + 1 bludgeoning damage and you gain +1 natural armor bonus for 1 round.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 bludgeoning damage and +¼ to the ac boost

			<br><br><br><b class="earthSubHeader">Earth Rumble [ 4 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Strike the ground with as much force as you can muster, causing the very earth to ripple and shake outward from you.
			<br>
			All creatures within a 5 foot radius must make a Reflex or Fortitude save against this Tac’s DC or else take 1d10 + 2 damage and fall prone. Any creature who is already prone receives no save. If you are falling, you may cast this as you approach the ground. If you do, the radius and damage increases based on how far you fell. For every 10 feet you fell, increase the DC by 1, the radius by 5 feet, and the damage by 1d10. You take no fall damage when you use this Tac successfully.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 to the DC and +2 Bludgeoning damage

			<br><br><br><b class="earthSubHeader">Earth Grip [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Force the earth to mold itself around a helpless body, sealing it in a shell of hardened stone.
			<br>
			The shell prevents the body from moving, and protects it from attacks. The shell has 10 HP and 8 + your charisma AC. You may choose to allow for small breathing holes in the shell if you wish. This Tac is cast as an action and lasts for 1 round, but can be maintained as a free action next turn by paying the mana cost.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 to the AC and your charisma modifier to the HP.

			<br><br><br><b class="earthSubHeader">Earth Armor [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Coat your body in dirt, hardened to stone where it can.
			<br>
			For 1 round, you gain DR/Adamantine 1 and Energy Reduction 1. This lasts for 1 round, but can be maintained as a free action next turn by paying the mana cost.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the DR/Adamantine and Energy Reduction by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="earthSubHeader">Create Rock [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Pull minerals from the earth and form them into a hard rock in your hands.
			<br>
			This is a very simple Tac. You can cast this Tac as an action. For 1 round, this rock is infused with your unarmed strength. The rock can be thrown or slung as any other stone, but is treated as a weapon with a x3 crit modifier and a base damage equal to your unarmed strike damage + your strength modifier. You do not have to be the one to throw the rock in order for it to deal this damage.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the bludgeoning damage of the rock by +1.

			<br><br><br><b class="earthSubHeader">Rock Smash [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Take a chunk of stone in your hand and bring it down upon your opponent’s head.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as a part of an unarmed strike. This adds 1d4 + 2 to the strike. If you have a rock you formed using the Create Rock Tac, you may use its damage instead of 1d4. If the attack is a soft crit, then the crit multiplier is increased by 1. If the attack is a crit, then the crit multiplier is increased by 2. 
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the damage by 2.

			<br><br><br><b class="earthSubHeader">Earth Rush [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Gather the earth to yourself, reinforcing your movements with its strength. 
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as part of a Charge Action. For the duration of the charge, you have armor with 10 HP. If an object or creature is in the way of your charge, your armor takes 5 points of damage. If the obstruction is a creature, you may make an Overrun maneuver against them. If you are successful, they take the 5 damage instead. While your armor holds, your charge cannot be stopped by anyone but you. 
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase Armor HP by 4 and damage by 2

			<br><br><br><b class="earthSubHeader">Earth Bend [ 2 Mana ] [ EXCLUSIVE ]</b>
			<br> With a single shift of your body, you can shift the very earth beneath you.
			<br>
			As long as you are in contact with the earth, you may use this Tac to cause a 5 foot cube section of the earth within 30 feet to shift 5 feet in any direction, but not into an occupied space, with the surrounding earth reforming to support it. This Tac can be cast as an action, or as a part of casting any other Earth Tac. This Tac can only be cast once per round.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: This Tac cannot be ranked up.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="acidHeader"> Acid Tacs </b>
			<br> 
		<div class="classFeature">
			<br><br><b class="acidSubHeader">Acid Jab [ 1 Mana ] [ BASIC ]</b>
			<br> Jab your foe, acid dripping from your hand.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as part of an unarmed strike. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 + 1 acid damage and reduces the ac of the target’s armor or natural armor or shield by 1 until the start of your next turn. If the target has no armor bonus, instead double the acid damage dealt by this attack.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 acid damage and 1 to the ac reduction.

			<br><br><br><b class="acidSubHeader">Toxic Deluge- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Conjure a glob of specialized acid and send it to cover an opponent nearby.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as an action, and its effects last 1 turn. If the target fails a reflex save, their elemental resistances are reduced by 1. If they are immune to an element, they take 1 step backward instead. (If they heal from damage, they are immune. If they are immune, they halve. If they halve, they now have resistance equal to their level that can be reduced) This damage can stack, up to reducing the target’s resistance to 0.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the DC by 1, and the resistance reduction by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="acidSubHeader">Consuming Strike- [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Spying an opening in your foe’s defenses, strike with acid primed to eat away at their exposed flesh.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as a part of an unarmed strike. If the target has no armor bonus, then deal an additional 2d6+2 acid damage.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the damage by 1d6+1.

			<br><br><br><b class="acidSubHeader">Gear Hungry- [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Conjure a dripping coat of acid in your hand, and reach out for an opponent’s weapon, tool, armor, or shield in an attempt to ruin it.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as a part of a Disarm maneuver. If it is successful, deal 1d4+1 damage to the target item. This damage bypasses the item’s hardness, and if it reduces its hp to half, then the item gains the broken condition. If it reduces the hp of the item to 0, then the item is destroyed and becomes useless.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the damage by 1 and add 1 to your CMB to disarm.

			<br><br><br><b class="acidSubHeader">Toxic Cloud- [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Take a deep breath and exhale, allowing poisonous gas to spill out of your mouth and form an orb that, when broken, fills the area with a purplish haze.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as an action. Select a space with 10 feet and throw the ball of gas there. Until the start of your next turn, the area within 10 feet of this location is filled with poisonous gas. Any creature who enters the area or starts their turn there must make a fortitude save or else gain 1 sickened level. The sickness lasts until they have a chance to take a long rest, and stacks up to 1.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the DC by 1 and the maximum stack level by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="acidSubHeader">Blob Body- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Cover your body with excess acid, hoping to burn anyone foolish enough to strike you.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as an action and lasts 1 round, though it can be maintained as a free action next turn by paying the mana cost. When an enemy strikes you and deals damage with a physical melee attack or touch attack, the acid splashes off a bit and deals 1 point of acid damage to anyone within 5 feet. If this Tac is active, Earth Armor cannot be active on you, lest it be dissolved.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the damage by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="acidSubHeader">Acid Spit- [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Spit forth a glob of toxic sludge from your mouth at your opponent. 
			<br>
			Depending on where it strikes them, they may suffer a variety of negative effects. Make a ranged touch attack at a target within 20 feet. If the attack hits, you deal 1d6+1 points of acid damage and roll a d4. If:
			<br>1- They are hit in the eyes and are blinded for 1 round.
			<br>2- They are hit in the mouth and cannot speak for 1 round.
			<br>3- They are hit in the arm and take -1 on attack rolls for 1 round.
			<br>4- They are hit in the body and have their crit guard reduced by 1 for 1 round.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the acid damage, attack roll penalty, and crit guard reduction by 1. 

			<br><br><br><b class="acidSubHeader">Lasting Corrosion- [ 1 Mana ] [ EXCLUSIVE ]</b>
			<br> Intensify the acid dripping from your pores, causing its damage to last.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as an action or as a part of casting another Acid Tac. As long as this Tac is in effect, all AC and Resistance damage remains. This Tac can only be cast once per round.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: This Tac cannot be ranked up.
