		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="waterHeader"> Water Tacs </b>
			<br> 
		<div class="classFeature">
			<br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Water Slap [ 1 Mana ] [ BASIC ]</b>
			<br> Smack a target with the force of a small wave.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as part of an unarmed strike. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 + 1 bludgeoning damage and the target is pushed 5 feet. If they are obstructed, they instead take an additional 1 bludgeoning damage.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 bludgeoning damage to the initial strike and the additional damage for being pushed into an obstruction.

			<br><br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Wave Kick- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Kick forward, sending a wave pushing forward, bulrushing creatures caught.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as a part of an unarmed strike. The wave moves 20 feet in the direction you kick, moving along the ground until it hits an obstruction or a lack of ground.  Make a CMB check against the CMD of every creature the wave meets. If it is higher, then the wave pushes those creatures until the end of its movement. Any creature slammed into a wall or another creature takes 1d6 + 1 bludgeoning damage for each such slam. 
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Add 1 to the CMB and 1 to the damage, and 5 foot to the distance.

			<br><br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Dam The River- [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Calm your breathing and focus on the water around you, priming it to move at a moment’s notice.
			<br>
			For 1 turn, any water Tac you cast pushes 10 extra feet and deals an additional 2 damage on hit and on each collision. This Tac takes an action to cast initially, but can be maintained as a free action each turn by spending the Mana cost.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: increase the damage by 2

			<br><br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Geyser Stomp- [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Stomp the earth, sending water below, then summon it back out with a mighty geyser.
			<br>
			Pick a space within reach for the geyser to come from. Any creature in this space must succeed at a reflex save to halve 1d6 + 2 bludgeoning damage. If they fail the save, they are launched up to 15 feet upward and fall back in their own square or any adjacent square of your choice, taking the appropriate fall damage. If there is a prone creature adjacent to you, you may choose to cast this as part of an unarmed strike against them. If you do, they get no save and this Tac’s damage is multiplied on a critical hit. If you use this Tac on yourself, you take no damage and may reduce the height of the geyser as you desire.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: increase the DC by 1, the distance by 5 feet, and the damage by 2

			<br><br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Hydro Cannon- [ 4 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Summon forth a tube of water, pressurizing it until it breaks loose and fires at your opponents.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as a part of an unarmed strike. If it hits, then they take 2d6 + 2 bludgeoning damage and you must make a CMB check to bulrush. If that is successful, they are launched 10 feet backwards. If they strike a creature or solid surface, Both creatures take that same damage again. 
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: increase the distance by 10 feet and the damage by 2

			<br><br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Rough Tide- [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Raise your arms and let the waters follow suit.
			<br>
			If you are on dry ground, the area within 30 feet of you becomes waterlogged and is considered difficult terrain for 1 round. If a body of water is within the area, it becomes violent and attempts to drown anyone small enough in its area. The Swim DC to avoid being held under the water is 14. This Tac takes an action to cast, but can be maintained as a free action next turn by spending the Mana cost. 
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: increase the DC by 1

			<br><br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Ocean Mist- [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Summon forth water from all around you, forming a mist in the area and drenching everything.
			<br>
			For 1 round, the area within 10 feet of you is covered in a wet mist. The mist does not obscure vision, but clings to creatures within its area. This enables invisible creatures to be seen and fires to be dowsed. Any creatures made of fire in the area take 1d6 + 1 damage. 
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: increase the radius by 5 feet, and the damage by 1d6+1.

			<br><br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Prehensile Cohesion- [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Focus water around your arms, using surface tension to form tubes of coagulated water that can flail about on your command.
			<br>
			This Tac takes an action to cast, and grants + 5 foot reach to unarmed attacks. In addition, All water Tacs cast as a part of an unarmed strike while you are under the effects of Prehensile Cohesion are treated as if they are 1 rank higher. This Tac can be maintained next round as a free action by spending the mana cost.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: increase the reach bonus by 5 feet.

			<br><br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Cyclone Push- [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Pull water around you in a ring, then expand it outward rapidly, slamming foes away.
			<br>
			This Tac takes an action to cast. All creatures within your reach must make a fortitude save or be pushed 10 feet. If they are pushed into an obstruction or a creature, they and the obstruction take damage equal to your unarmed strike + 2.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the collision damage by 2, the push distance by 5, and the DC by 1

			<br><br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Ride the Waves- [ 0 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Level your breathing and cause the water to do the same.
			<br>
			For 1 round, you and any creatures within 20 feet that you choose may stand upon the surface of any water as if it was solid ground. This Tac can be cast as an action or as a part of casting another water Tac an action to cast. This Tac affects creature’s interactions with all water, including your other water Tacs. This Tac can only be cast once per round.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: This Tac cannot be ranked up

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="iceHeader"> Ice Tacs </b>
			<br> 
		<div class="classFeature">
			<br><br><b class="iceSubHeader">Ice Chop [ 1 Mana ] [ BASIC ]</b>
			<br> Form small icicles on your hand and chop your foe.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as part of an unarmed strike. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 piercing damage + 1 cold damage and the target suffers -1 to CMB and CMD until the start of your next turn. These debuffs do stack.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 cold damage add -1 to the CMB and CMD debuff.

			<br><br><br><b class="iceSubHeader">Ice Them- [ 5 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Conjure as much cold as you can and fill your opponent with it, shutting them down and subduing them immediately.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as an action. If there is a prone or helpless creature within reach, you may make a CMB grapple against them. If you succeed, they make a fortitude save or else fall unconscious and cease all internal processes. While they are like this, their bodies do not age, think, act, poisons and diseases are halted, and they are completely stiff. You may keep them like this as long as you spend 1 Mana each turn. At any time during this, you may choose to end their life by unfreezing them wrong. When you wish for them to wake, you may release them and they will return to waking in 1 minute.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the DC by 1.
			
			<br><br><br><b class="iceSubHeader">Bone Chill- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Conjure cold to surround an enemy and chill them to their core, weakening them against your attacks.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as an action. Choose a target within 40 feet. If the target fails a fortitude save, their crit guard is reduced by 1 and they gain brittle bones, giving them Vulnerability 1 (Bludgeoning) for 1 round. You can maintain this effect next round by paying the mana cost.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the DC, crit guard reduction, and the Vulnerability (B) by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="iceSubHeader">Bitter Cold- [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Focus the cold on yourself, sapping the warmth from the air nearby and channeling to keep some warm and freeze others who would strain themselves.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as an action or as part of casting another Ice Tac. For 1 round, you are surrounded by a 15 foot radius zone of cold. This can be maintained as a free action next turn by spending the mana cost. All who would enter or start their turn in this area must succeed at a fortitude save or else suffer 1 cold damage for every attack, spell, or step they take beyond 5 feet in one action. If a spellcaster fails the save, they cannot cast a spell in the area if that spell has Somatic components. For each time that a creature is reintroduced to the cold and for each time that Bitter Cold is maintained, they must roll a new save.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the DC and the damage by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="iceSubHeader">Coldtrops- [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Manifest cold in the form of many small, razor sharp icicle caltrops and cast them around.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as an action, or as a part of casting another Ice Tac. You generate enough coldtrops to cover 4 squares. You may choose any squares within 30 feet to place them, provided they are not blocked. Occupied spaces do not count as blocked. Any creature who moves into or out of a space with coldtrops as a part of any movement that is more than 5 feet takes 1 point of cold damage and has their movement speed halved for 1 turn.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the damage by 1 and the number of squares you can fill by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="iceSubHeader">FrostBite- [ 4 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Reach deep into your foe, pulling forth as much of their crucial inner warmth as you can and consuming it.
			<br>
			This Tac takes an action to cast, and requires a successful Steal maneuver to strike. If the maneuver hits, you deal 1d6 + 1 cold damage plus extra based on how many debuffs are currently on the opponent. If:
			<br>Halved movement- 1 more damage and 1 more point of healing
			<br>CMB or CMD reduction- 1 more damage and 1 more point of healing
			<br>Vulnerability- 1 more damage and 1 more point of healing
			<br>Crit Guard Reduced- 1 more damage and 1 more point of healing
			<br>Any other debuffs- 1 more damage and 1 more point of healing
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the base damage by 1d6+1 and the damage and healing for each of the debuff effects by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="iceSubHeader">Freezer Burn- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Grip your opponent for just a moment, searing their skin with cold before letting them go once more.
			<br>
			This Tac takes an action to cast and requires a successful grapple maneuver to strike. If the maneuver succeeds, you grab your enemy and deal 2 points of cold damage with your hands before letting them go. In the place you grabbed them, their skin has been burned. For 1 round, they have Vulnerability 1 (Cold). You store the heat from their skin, so the next Water Tac you cast within 1 minute gains Steam Power 1.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the cold damage by 2, the Vulnerability (Cold) by 1, and the Steam Power by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="iceSubHeader">StalagmIce- [ 0 Mana ] [ EXCLUSIVE ]</b>

This Tac can only be cast once per round.
