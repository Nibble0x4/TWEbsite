	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> The Artisan </b>
	<br> The world is full of adventurers. Experienced warriors, skilled rogues, powerful masters of magic,and scions of the divine. All of these are laudable pursuits that bring great power and prestige. However, in the towns that these adventurers visit, there are individuals with incredible skills that perform equally magnificent feats without ever striking down an enemy. These people are the blacksmith, the carpenter, the tanner, and even the construction worker. These people form the backbone of the society that warriors protect. These people make the world we live in. These people are the artisans.


	<br><br><b>Role</b>: Artisans are not inherently adventurous, combat-oriented, or powerful, but they carry the power to create. With their hands, they can produce gear for the party to use or tinker on whatever little projects they can dream up. They collect and utilize the materials from the world around them to accomplish whatever they can imagine. The artisan is a class with very little combat capability or survivability that relies on creative use of downtime and out-of-game ingenuity to succeed. Do not take this class lightly.

		<hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader">Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>
		<br> An Artisan is proficient with all simple weapons, but is not proficient with armor shields. See weapon lists <a href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html">HERE</a>. See Armor lists <a href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/ArmorPage.html">HERE</a>.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Crafting Excellence </b>
		<br> An artisan is a master with his hands. He gains a bonus on craft checks equal to his artisan level.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Dismantle </b>
		<br> The artisan can use his technical knowledge to do more than just create his own objects. He may use his craft skill to interact with mechanisms such as locks or harvest parts from systems such as machinery or corpses. He may also use his craft skill to attempt to give the broken condition to a crafted item or to hamper a construct, depending on his described method.
		<br> If the artisan attempts to dismantle an object that contains materials of a grade that he cannot use, then those materials are lost in the process.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Tricks of the Trade </b>
		<br> At 1st level, the artisan gains access to a list of Artisan-exclusively feats known as Tricks of the Trade. Whenever they would gain a feat, they may choose to take an feat from that list. In addition, they gain a Trick of the Trade now. Finally, depending on where they learned their craft, an artisan in TWE gains the “Cultural Weaponsmith” Trick of the Trade matching their culture of origin.
		<br> At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the artisan gains a new Trick of the Trade.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Tier Increase </b>
		<br> At 2nd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the artisan may increase his Tier rating in any one of the specialties he has access to by 1.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Creation </b>
		<br> A Specialist can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The Specialist rolls 1d20 and adds her Specialist level and her Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.
		<br><br>
		To use wild empathy, the Specialist and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.
		<br><br>
		The Specialist can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.
