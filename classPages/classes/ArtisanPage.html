	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> The Artisan </b>
	<br> The world is full of adventurers. Experienced warriors, skilled rogues, powerful masters of magic,and scions of the divine. All of these are laudable pursuits that bring great power and prestige. However, in the towns that these adventurers visit, there are individuals with incredible skills that perform equally magnificent feats without ever striking down an enemy. These people are the blacksmith, the carpenter, the tanner, and even the construction worker. These people form the backbone of the society that warriors protect. These people make the world we live in. These people are the artisans.


	<br><br><b>Role</b>: Artisans are not inherently adventurous, combat-oriented, or powerful, but they carry the power to create. With their hands, they can produce gear for the party to use or tinker on whatever little projects they can dream up. They collect and utilize the materials from the world around them to accomplish whatever they can imagine. The artisan is a class with very little combat capability or survivability that relies on creative use of downtime and out-of-game ingenuity to succeed. Do not take this class lightly.

	<br><br> 
		

		<hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader">Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>
		<br> An Artisan is proficient with all simple weapons, but is not proficient with armor shields. See weapon lists <a href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html">HERE</a>. See Armor lists <a href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/ArmorPage.html">HERE</a>.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Crafting Excellence </b>
		<br> An artisan is a master with his hands. He gains a bonus on craft checks equal to his artisan level.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Dismantle </b>
		<br> The artisan can use his technical knowledge to do more than just create his own objects. He may use his craft skill to interact with mechanisms such as locks or harvest parts from systems such as machinery or corpses. He may also use his craft skill to attempt to give the broken condition to a crafted item or to hamper a construct, depending on his described method.
		<br> If the artisan attempts to dismantle an object that contains materials of a grade that he cannot use, then those materials are lost in the process.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Tricks of the Trade </b>
		<br> At 1st level, the artisan gains access to a list of Artisan-exclusively feats known as <a href="artisanPages/TricksoftheTrade.html">Tricks of the Trade</a>. Whenever they would gain a feat, they may choose to take an feat from that list. In addition, they gain a Trick of the Trade now. Finally, depending on where they learned their craft, an artisan in TWE gains the “Cultural Weaponsmith” Trick of the Trade matching their culture of origin.
		<br> At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the artisan gains a new Trick of the Trade.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Tier Increase </b>
		<br> At 2nd level, and every 2 levels thereafter, the artisan may increase his Tier rating in any one of the specialties he has access to by 1.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Creation </b>
		<br> The artisan, as a class, is defined by their ability to create things. Given the correct amount of materials from the following Artisan Material List and enough time, he can create almost anything. 
		<br> In order to create an object, the artisan must first determine its category. The objects that he can create fall under the following categories:
		<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Weapons and Armor</b>
			<br> The objects in this category are the traditional weaponry of the world. Based upon the artisan’s Tier, he may use materials and proper tools to fashion swords, lances, bows, arrows, crossbows, shields, different armors, anything one would find at a traditional armorer. He may also attempt to augment them in ways that please him.
			<br><br>
			These objects typically require heavy use of blacksmithing tools, accompanied by the occasional carpentry tools.
		<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Contraptions</b>
			<br> The objects in this category are the most difficult to define. A contraption is a machine that can be used to accomplish a function. Contraptions can range in complexity from a boot with a climbing spike embedded in the sole to a carefully designed bomb casing equipped with a small propeller to ensure that the bomb goes off when enough wind is generated to spin the propeller. This category is recommended only for artisans who are heavily creative and are willing to work with the GM as well as work alone out-of-game to create plans for such creations.
			<br><br>
			These objects typically require use of carpentry tools and blacksmithing tools, though handicraft tools are commonly needed as well. 
		<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Accessories</b>
			<br> This category includes a wide range of items from jewelry to clothing. Anything that can be worn that isn’t a traditional weapon or armor would be considered in this category. They are not typically ideal for battle, but artisans who specialize in these objects can make beautiful and elegant items that sell for large sums of money and are excellent receptacles of magic.
			<br><br>
			These objects typically require Handicraft tools.
		<br><br>

		As the Artisan grows, so will his ability to handle increasingly complex projects. Each Artisan has a Tier ranking in each of the different item creation categories. His Tier ranking determines his Manageable CP (Complexity Points) for projects in that category. Below is a small table showing the Manageable CP of an Artisan at each of the Tiers.

		As this process is so important, a rough step-by-step process is given below:

		<ol>
			<li><b>The Artisan draws up a blueprint of the project, allowing them to determine with the GM’s help what materials and tools will be used.</b></li>
			<li><b>Determine the CP of the project. </b></li>
			<ol>
				<li>Use the <a href="artisanPages/Materials.html">Materials List</a> to determine the CP of each distinct material being used. Add them together.</li>
				<li>If the project is masterwork, use the <a href="artisanPages/BaseDCandCP.html">Extra Quality CP table</a> to determine any extra CP for this project.</li>
				<li>If there are any CP changes from Tricks of the Trade, factor them in.</li>
				<li>If the CP is less than or equal to the Artisan's manageable CP in the crafting category, then continue! If not, he may need to break the project down into smaller projects, if possible, and assemble them later.</li>
			</ol>
			<li><b>Determine the DC of the project. </b></li>
			<ol>
				<li>Multiply the DC per Unit value of each material being used by the number of units being used.</li>
				<li>Add the material DCs together.</li>
				<li>Determine the base DC of the project using the <a href="artisanPages/BaseDCandCP.html">appropriate table</a>.</li>
				<li>Multiply the CP of this project by 20 and add that to the DC.</li>
				<li>If there are any DC changes from Tricks of the Trade, factor them in.</li>
			</ol>
			<li><b>The final DC has been found! You now know what is required to craft the item.</b></li>
			<li><b>Gather all the materials you need.</b></li>
			<li><b>Ensure you have a tool that can handle the materials being used. Here is a helpful list of well-known <a href="artisanPages/Tools.html">Artisan Tools</a>.</b></li>
			<li><b>Crafting time!</b></li>
			<ol>
				<li>The Artisan can spend 2 hours to perform a Crafting Session.</li>
				<li>Once per session, he may roll a Craft check, adding the result to a running total for the project.</li>
				<li>If he rolls a natural 20 on his check, he may make an additional check, adding the two together for his Session.</li>
				<li>If he rolls a natural 1 on his check, he wastes his Session without making any progress.</li>
				<li>Once the running total for his project meets or exceeds the DC, he has finished crafting! The materials are used up and the item is created!</li>
			</ol>
		</ol>

		To use wild empathy, the Specialist and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.
		<br><br>
		The Specialist can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.
