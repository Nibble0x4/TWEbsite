	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> The Fluxcaster </b>
	<br> Far in the east, where magic has taken a whole new meaning, there exists a new breed of magician who redefines the term “caster.” These people are weak in body but strong in spirit. They carry within themselves reservoirs of this strange foreign power called flux. Fluxcasters eschew physical fitness and fortitude, tying their minds and spirits to flux in order to wield its power by calling forth flux into the physical world. Every fluxcaster is unique, wielding the diverse power of flux as a reflection of their own minds and personalities.

	<br><br><b>Role</b>: Flux casters have the weakest hp of all classes, and a relatively small pool of flux to use. However, they are incredibly unpredictable in and out of combat. Their powers can be used to attack, defend, or alter the battlefield to their benefit. They can hit incredibly hard, deny large amounts of damage, and turn the tide of combat, based on their caster type, and can fulfill practically any role except that of a typical magic user.

		<hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader">Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>
		<br> Flux Casters are not proficient with any armor or weapons or shields.
		<br><br>It is important to note that a fluxcaster adds their core ability modifier to their AC, as long as they still have 1 point of flux left in their flux pool. This is only true when the caster is wearing no armor at all. This bonus does not apply to attacks that they are unaware of.
		<br><br>This bonus means that fluxcasters are often encouraged to design costumes that can define them. It does not matter what these costumes are, as long as they are not innately protective. Some wear plain clothes, others wear simple cloaks, still others dress as opulently as possible. A fluxcaster is equally protected whether they are wearing a ninja’s gi, a simple robe, a fancy dress, or their mother’s drapes. 


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Flux-Use"> Flux Use </b>
		<br> Throughout TWE, the Aether is the force and substance that pervades reality. It is the stream that wizards and other magicians use to affect the world around them through the use of spells. In Areth, there exists an alternative to Aether. This alternative is an energy called Flux. Unlike Aether, its source lies in Areth only and its power is far more limited in scope. It cannot accomplish as many varied tasks as Aether, such as illusion magic, divination, necromancy, or enchantment. 

		<br><br>
		Flux, instead of relying on spells, can be used in a very free-flowing manner. Aether magic must be learned by the study of spells and their specific applications. For example, a wizard who wishes to save himself from falling to his death might learn the specific spell “feather fall” and commit it to memory. When he is falling, he will recall that spell and perform it exactly as he learned it. As a result of his casting, a very specific effect will come about. He may have the power to slow his fall in this specific way, but that does not mean that that wizard is able to control air or gravity in any other context. Flux works very differently. When a flux caster does his magic, he uses his mind and the flux within him to instantiate a form of energy. This instantiation is simply called his flux. He has summoned this flux and can control it. The way this flux looks, acts, feels, and behaves is all defined by the will and the personality of the caster. 
		<br><br>
		To take the example from the previous paragraph, where a wizard can simply cast a spell to fall more slowly, a flux caster would have to instantiate flux in some way so as to save himself from the fall based on the properties of his flux. Perhaps his flux is sturdy and smooth and he is skilled with forming objects on the fly. If that is the case, he may instantiate flux in the shape of a large slide. If his flux is liquid, he may try to instantiate a large amount of it in order to break his fall. The flux caster has more freedom to instantiate his flux in any way he desires than an aether mage, but more constraints on what his flux can do.
		<br><br>
		As a flux caster grows stronger, they gain more control over what their flux is and how well they can manipulate it. However, their flux is never harmful to themselves. Their flux comes from their bodies and is harmless to them.
		<br><br>
		The ways a flux caster can modify their flux casting are, generally, along these lines:
		<br> - Modify the physical aspects of their flux. Make it firm, liquid, magnetic, rubbery, etc.
		<br> - Improve the precision with which they can instantiate and manipulate their flux.
		<br> - Divide their attention to allow them to control flux instantiations subconsciously



		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Flux-Color"> Flux Color </b>
		<br> Flux casters are among the most identifiable classes out there. This is due in no small part to the nature of what flux looks like when it is instantiated. Flux is invisible energy. When it is wielded by a caster, however, it becomes imprinted by the essence of that caster. This results in the caster’s flux taking on a colored hue. This color comes as a result of the core personality traits of the caster and, short of something incredible, is never changed. This color causes the fluxcaster’s attacks, defense, and forms to all glow in the same color. This makes it easy to identify at a glance whose flux is whose, and is a source of pride among casters. 
		<br><br> 
		A fluxcaster’s color is determined at level 1 by no choice of their own.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Flux-Caster-Type"> Flux Caster Type </b>
		<br> Each flux caster, when they gain the power to use flux, gains a specialty based upon their strengths and personality. Each of these flux types specialize in different applications of flux. Once a caster has a type, they cannot change their type. Each caster, based on their type, uses a different mental ability score as their key score. This key score is important for defining how much flux they have access to and how powerful that flux is. The three types are:
		<br> - Attack Type Flux, they use Intelligence as their key score
		<br> - Defense Type Flux, they use Wisdom as their key score
		<br> - Support Type Flux, they use Charisma as their key score
		<br><br>


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Flux-Pool"> Flux Pool </b>
		<br> Each Caster has a pool of flux that they can draw from in order to perform acts of power. They can instantiate flux only so long as their flux pool is not empty.
		<br><br> 
		This pool contains a number of points equal to [her flux caster level + her key ability modifier]. This value is affected by temporary bonuses to her key ability modifier (such as a magical item or spell that grants +4 cha), but only if the bonus is active on the flux caster when she wakes up that morning. If her key ability score is increased during the day, no additional flux points are added to her pool. If her key ability score is decreased during the day, however, she may lose points from her pool that will only be regained upon a long rest.
		<br><br>
		In addition, a flux caster gains bonus points to her flux pool for having a large key ability modifier apart from items or temporary buffs. The details are shown in the following table:

		As long as the Flux Caster’s Flux Pool is not yet empty, their frail bodies are protected by the power they hold inside. As long as their pool has at least 1 point in it, they gain a deflection bonus to their ac equal to their key ability modifier.

		<br><br><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Basic-Flux-Actions"> Basic Flux Actions </b>
		<br> Each Flux Caster, no matter how inexperienced, can reliably perform 3 basic actions. However, They will naturally be better at different actions depending on which type of Flux Caster they are. The three basic actions are:
		<br><br>
		<b><u>Attack: </u></b>
		<br>As an action, the Flux Caster instantiates glowing Flux energy and uses it to attack her enemies. When she does this, she has several options for how to deliver it. Each method has different perks and drawbacks and each method costs a different amount of Flux to be used.
		<br><b>Melee (1 point): </b> Her hand glows with energy and she makes a melee attack against a target she can reach. If she hits, she deals 1d4 damage per Flux Caster level [1d4 per FluxCaster level] to her target. 
		<br>
		<br><b>Ray (1 point): </b> Her hands glow with energy and release a bolt of Flux at a target within 30 feet. She makes a ranged attack against her target. If she hits, she deals [1d4-1 per FluxCaster level] damage to her target.		
		<br><br><b> Area Attacks(2 points):</b> Her whole body glows with energy and she releases a large amount of flux over a large area. All creatures in the area except her must succeed at a reflex save (DC = 10 + ½ lvl + core ability mod) to take half of the damage. The damage dealt by these attacks is [1d4 per 2 Flux Caster levels]. The attack can be of any of the following shapes:
		<br><b>Laser!</b><i>Line: </i> A 60 foot line starting at her.
		<br><b>Spray!</b><i>Cone: </i> A 30 foot cone coming from her.
		<br><b>Explosion!</b><i>Burst: </i> A 20 foot burst centered on her.

		<br><br><br>
		<b><u> Defend: </u></b> 
		<br>When the Flux Caster takes damage from an attack she is aware of, she may, before the damage is revealed, declare a defense. When she does this, her body is protected by a mass of Flux and she may choose to spend a number of Flux Points from her pool equal to or less than her core ability modifier. She then rolls [1d4 per Flux Caster level] for each point of Flux she spent. The total from her roll is subtracted from the total damage that she would have taken. If her defense is greater than the damage she would have taken, she takes no damage and any extra defense from her roll is lost. 
		<br><br>
		<i>Example- </i>
		<br> Aaron the archer attacks Felix the fluxcaster twice by shooting arrows. The first attack misses but the second attack beats Felix’s AC. In this case, before the damage is revealed, Felix may choose to defend himself. Felix is an attack type fluxcaster and has an int modifier of 4. He may choose to spend either 1,2,3, or 4 flux points to defend himself. Felix is cautious and spends 2 points. Felix is a level 3 fluxcaster, so he rolls 2 * 3 = 6d4. Let us say he rolls a total of 13. Aaron now rolls damage. Aaron’s arrow deals 15 damage, so Felix takes 2 damage. 


		<br><br><br>
		<b><u> Form: </u></b>
		<br>As an action, the Fluxcaster can choose to form a more generalized instantiation of their flux. This does not appear as an attack or as a defense but rather as a tool that is only as powerful as its user is creative. 
		<br><br>
		The fluxcaster may pick an unoccupied location within 30 feet of them and instantiate a mass of flux there. When they do this, a 5x5x2 foot screen of flux appears and blocks passage. 
		<br>Any creature or item that makes contact with the screen takes 1 damage per fluxcaster level the creator possesses and is blocked from advancing. These screens can be attacked and destroyed. A weapon that is used to successfully pierce the AC of a screen does not take damage.
		<br>The screens have an AC of 10 and are immune to force damage, but can otherwise be damaged as any other object could. They have hp equal to 2 * their creator’s fluxcaster level.
		<br>The screens are mindless.
		<br>The screens can be oriented in any way the caster chooses.
		<br>The fluxcaster can choose to spend a number of flux points up to her core ability modifier when she uses Form. For every point she spends, she may create 1 screen of flux. These screens do not have to be in contact with each other, but must be within 30 feet of her.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Favored-Form"> Favored Form </b>
		<br> At 1st level, each flux caster learns to become proficient at Forming a particular shape or item. This typically is due to an admiration, experience, or just fondness that the caster has toward an object or shape.
		<br><br>
		At level 1, the flux caster may select a shape other than a screen. It is more complex than a simple square screen, but also is smaller and less robust/painful. They make this selection at 1st level and they cannot change their selection later. This shape is something that they find particularly useful or meaningful to them. They can Form this shape with the Form action instead of a screen, but it is limited in size to something fit for a human. This instantiation does not harm people like the screens do, and lasts until dispersed or until destroyed. Once created, these instantiations can be physically moved about just like any other item might. 
		<br>- These items have hp equal to ½ the HP of the screens.
		<br>- These items have an AC of 10.
		<br>- These items are mindless.
		<br><br>
		<i>Example- </i>
		<br> Freddy the Flux caster is a defense flux caster with an admiration for birds. At first level, he chooses wings as his special Form shape. He can expend a point of flux to conjure these wings. The wings are made entirely out of flux and are not capable of flight, but take the shape of wings and can be bent or folded like wings and can also be instantiated attached to the back of a willing creature in range. As Freddy gets stronger, he may choose to design arts involving this special Form.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Flux-Advanced-Actions"> Flux Advanced Actions </b>
		<br> Each different type of fluxcaster gains a different flux advanced action at level 1. This advanced action replaces one of the basic actions of the fluxcaster. Each advanced action can accomplish everything a simple action can, and works very similarly, but is stronger and has more potential for use.
		<br><br>
		<b><u>Advanced Attack: </u></b>
		<br>This action replaces the basic Attack action. The attack caster can deal more damage with her flux attacks than normal, and her area attacks are cheaper and harder to avoid. Below is the modified Attack action.
		<br><br>
		As an action, the Flux Caster instantiates glowing Flux energy and uses it to attack her enemies. When she does this, she has several options for how to deliver it. Each method has different perks and drawbacks and each method requires a different amount of Flux to be used.
		<br><b>Melee (1 point): </b> Her hand glows with energy and she makes a melee attack against a target she can reach. If she hits, she deals [1d6 per FluxCaster level] damage to her target. 
		<br>
		<br><b>Ray (1 point): </b> Her hands glow with energy and release a bolt of Flux at a target within 30 feet. She makes a ranged attack against her target. If she hits, she deals [1d6-1 per FluxCaster level] damage to her target.	
		<br><br><b> Area Attacks(2 points):</b> Her whole body glows with energy and she releases a large amount of flux over a large area. All creatures in the area except her must succeed at a reflex save (DC = 10 + ½ lvl + int mod + 2) to take half of the damage. The damage dealt by these attacks is [1d6 per 2 Flux Caster levels]. The attack can be of any of the following shapes:
		<br><b>Laser!</b><i>Line: </i> A 60 foot line starting at her.
		<br><b>Spray!</b><i>Cone: </i> A 30 foot cone coming from her.
		<br><b>Explosion!</b><i>Burst: </i> A 20 foot burst centered on her.

		<br><br><br>
		<b><u> Advanced Defend: </u></b> 
		<br> This action replaces the basic Defend action. The defense caster can more effectively protect herself from incoming attacks. In addition, her AC is boosted whenever she chooses to defend herself at least once on her turn. Below is the modified Defend action.

		<br><br>When the Flux Caster takes damage from an attack she is aware of she may, before the damage is revealed, declare a defense. When she does this, her body is protected by a mass of Flux and she may choose to spend a number of Flux Points from her pool equal to or less than her core ability modifier. She then rolls [1d6 per Flux Caster level] for each point of Flux she spent. The total from her roll is subtracted from the total damage that she would have taken. If her defense is greater than the damage she would have taken, she takes no damage and any extra defense from her roll is lost.  
		<br> <i>IN ADDITION</i>, the first time a defense fluxcaster uses a defend action (not a defend instantiation) on their turn, they may roll 1 defense die and add the result to their AC for that round.

		<br><br>
		<i>Example- </i>
		<br> Aaron the archer attacks Felix the fluxcaster twice by shooting arrows. The first attack misses but the second attack beats Felix’s AC. In this case, before the damage is revealed, Felix may choose to defend himself. Felix is an attack type fluxcaster and has an int modifier of 4. He may choose to spend either 1,2,3, or 4 flux points to defend himself. Felix is cautious and spends 2 points. Felix is a level 3 fluxcaster, so he rolls 2 * 3 = 6d4. Let us say he rolls a total of 13. Aaron now rolls damage. Aaron’s arrow deals 15 damage, so Felix takes 2 damage. 

		<br><br><br>
		<b><u> Advanced Form: </u></b>
		<br> This action replaces the basic Form action. The support caster has more power and control over what she forms and how powerful it is. She can form larger, tougher, more painful screens from further away. 
		<br><br>As an action, the Fluxcaster can choose to form a more generalized instantiation of their flux. This does not appear as an attack or as a defense but rather as a tool that is only as powerful as its user is creative. 
		<br><br>
		The fluxcaster may pick an unoccupied location within 30 feet of them and instantiate a mass of flux there. When they do this, up to a 10x10x4 foot screen of flux appears and blocks passage. 
		<br>Any creature or item that makes contact with the screen takes 1d4 damage per fluxcaster level the creator possesses and is blocked from advancing. These screens can be attacked and destroyed. A weapon that is used to successfully pierce the AC of a screen does not take damage.
		<br>The screens have an AC equal to the current AC of their creator (min 10) and are immune to force damage, but can otherwise be damaged as any other object could. They have hp equal to 4 * their creator’s fluxcaster level.
		<br>The screens are mindless.
		<br>The screens can be oriented in any way the caster chooses.
		<br>The fluxcaster can choose to spend a number of flux points up to her core ability modifier when she uses Form. For every point she spends, she may create 2 screens of flux. These screens do not have to be in contact with each other, but must be within 30 feet of her.
		<br><i>In addition</i>, at level 1, the Support flux caster’s Favored Form ability is strengthened.
		<br> Her Favored Forms are identical to her screens in terms of:
			Hp, AC, Damage, and Mindless nature.
		<br><br><b><u>Free-Form:</u></b> 
		<br> The Support flux caster can also choose to instantiate any other shape they can think of when they use Form, but it follows the rules of a Defense or Attack flux caster’s Favored Form ability. When they do so, it is called Free-Form.





		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Flux Development </b>
		<br> Each fluxcaster is unique and this is reflected in more than just the color of their flux. When a fluxcaster begins, their flux is simply energy. It is colored hard-light. However, as she grows, a fluxcaster can shape and mold her flux to better reflect her style. 
		<br><br>
		This is where Flux Developments come in. At 2nd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a fluxcaster can grow her abilities by developing how she instantiates her flux. This manifests by changing something basic about the flux.
		<br><br>
		Perhaps the flux becomes sticky like honey, hard and inflexible like steel, caustic like acid, bouncy like rubber, or squishy like mud.
		<br><br>
		There are 5 chances for a flux caster to develop her flux as she works towards level 20. Each time she has this chance, she can choose to develop her flux according to a stage system. The stages are as follows:
		<br><br><div class="classFeature"> 
			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Stage 1</b>
			<br>  Basic textural change
			<br><b> -</b> <i>Example:</i>  Slippery like oil.
			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Stage 2</b>
			<br> Advanced Physical change
			<br><b> -</b> <i>Example:</i>  Reflective like glass.
			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Stage 3</b>
			<br> Magical change
			<br><b> -</b> <i>Example:</i>  Accelerates objects that touch it.
		</div>
		<p class="body-text">
		<br><br> 
		When a flux caster reaches 2nd level, she must select a Stage 1 development for her flux. After that, whenever a flux caster gains an opportunity to develop their flux, she can choose to advance her flux or to develop a new branch of flux for herself. If she chooses to develop an existing branch, then she can choose a development from any stage equal to or 1 higher than that branch’s current highest development Stage.
		<br><br>
		<i>Example:</i> Stan the attack caster is level 14. At 2nd level, he chose a Stage 1 development for his flux so that it became sticky like honey. At 6th level, he chose to develop his sticky flux with a Stage 2 development that allowed it to become conductive like water or steel. At 10th level, he chose to start a new branch of flux with a Stage 1 development that made it grainy like sand. Now, at 14th level, he has chosen a Stage 3 development for his sticky conductive flux that allows it to be visible to him even if there are objects obstructing his view of it.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Disrupting Aura </b>
		<br> At 8th level, the Rune Knight has an exceptionally disruptive aura to spellcasters, her power and presence causing their hands to tremble and their minds to struggle. Any casters within 10 feet of the Rune Knight are considered threatened by her at all times and must cast defensively. This is true if the Rune Knight is alive, even if she is unarmed, unconscious, or bound.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Aura of Resolve </b>
		<br> At 11th level, a Rune Knight is immune to charm spells and spell-like abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against charm effects.
		<br><br>
		This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Spacial Lockdown </b>
		<br> At 14th level, a Rune Knight‘s presence is enough to alter the space around her. She emanates a 10 foot aura that locks the air, refusing to allow any teleportation or summoning effects to take place within the vicinity.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Arcane Lightning Rod </b>
		<br> At 17th level, a Rune Knight projects an aura of absolute magical protection about herself. Whenever a spell would target a creature within 10 feet of her, she may choose to force the spell to target her instead. If the spell would target her already, such as with an area-of-effect spell, she may choose to have it target her several times.
