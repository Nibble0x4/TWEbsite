	<p class="text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> The Rune Knight </b>
	<br> In a world where mages run rampant, calling upon gods and grasping at strands of aether to control the very fabric of reality through arcane study, someone must watch out for the common man. When a socially isolated psycho with a pointy hat decides to casually level a forest with a miniature sun or overrun a village with unspeakable horrors from another dimension, what hope does a regular farmer and his family have? There is only one answer, the Rune Knights. While other adventurers hone their bodies and minds to move as quickly and cleverly as possible, always reaching for more and more power, Enthan’s Rune Knights stand as a reminder that actions will always have consequences. These experienced warriors don their heavy armor, lift their trusty weapons, and wield them in the defense of humanity against magic. They cover their garb with arcane symbols that, through their many years of experience, they have seen to weaken magical power, and put their lives on the line to level the playing field against those who wield magic. When a wizard grips reality and attempts to morph it to his twisted whims, the Rune Knight stands up to him and firmly says, “No.”

	<br><br><b>Role</b>: The Rune Knight is a heavily armored class by necessity, relying on strong defenses to protect herself and her allies against not only physical attacks, but also magical ones. They grant Spell Resistance as protection from magic, and act as the immovable objects that mages simply must flee before.

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Class Features </b>
	<br> 
	<br><br> 

		<hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader">Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>
		<br> A Rune Knight is proficient with all simple and martial melee weapons and with light, medium, and heavy armor. They are also proficient with shields and tower shields. See weapon lists <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons#simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons">HERE</a>. See Armor lists <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/armor">HERE</a>.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Detect Magic </b>
		<br> At will, a Rune Knight can use <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-magic/" style="font-style: italic;">detect magic</a>, as the spell. A Rune Knight can, as a move action, concentrate on a single item or individual within 60 feet and determine if it is magic, learning the strength of its aura as if having studied it for 3 rounds. While focusing on one individual or object, the Rune Knight does not detect magic in any other object or individual within range.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Purge </b>
		<br> Once per day, a Rune Knight can focus her attention on a magical creature and attempt to wipe its filth from the earth. As a swift action, the Rune Knight chooses one target within sight to purge. If this target has spell slots, the Rune Knight adds her WIS bonus (if any) to her attack rolls and adds her Rune Knight level to all damage rolls made against the target of her purge. If the target of purge is a full caster (a class that gets 9th level spells), the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per level the Rune Knight possesses. Regardless of the target, purge attacks automatically bypass any DR the creature might possess.
		<br><br>
		In addition, while purge is in effect, the Rune Knight gains a deflection bonus equal to her Charisma modifier (if any) to her AC against attacks made by the target of the purge, as well as any existing SR she has against any spells cast by them. If the Rune Knight targets a creature that has no spell slots, the purge is wasted with no effect.
		<br><br>
		The purge effect remains until the target of the purge is dead or the next time the Rune Knight rests and regains her uses of this ability. At 4th level, and at every three levels thereafter, the Rune Knight may purge one additional time per day, as indicated on Table: Rune Knight, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Runic Protection </b>
		<br> At 2nd level, a Rune Knight gains a bonus equal to her Wisdom bonus (if any) on all Saving Throws.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Scribe Runes </b>
		<br> A Rune Knight protects herself from magic through the application of carefully scribed runes on her armor. 
		<br><br>
		Beginning at 2nd level, she can scribe arcane runes on her set of clothing or armor, granting it Spell Resistance(SR) equal to <b>10 + the armor’s Armor Bonus to AC</b>. If she changes armor, she can spend an hour transferring the runes from her old armor to her new armor.
		<br><br>
		The Rune Knight can also choose to extend this power to her allies in battle by touching them. When she does so, she can cause copies of her armor’s runes to appear on a willing creature’s garb (If they are clothed) and provide the same SR bonus to them that she herself enjoys. She can grant this bonus to others a number of times per day equal to <b>½ her Rune Knight level + her wisdom modifier</b>. However, she can only protect up to one other set at a time. If she protects a new set, she must choose to end an existing use. Each use of this ability lasts for a number of minutes equal to <b>The Rune Knight’s Rune Knight level</b>.
		<br><br>
		The number of sets she can choose to protect (In addition to her own) in this way is initially 1, but increases by 1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 6 at 20th level.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Defender's Aura </b>
		<br> A Rune Knight is trained in the defense of others, and this nurtures an instinct that allows her to protect people when others would have to merely watch them die.
		<br><br> 
		At 3rd level, whenever a creature within reach of the Rune Knight is targeted by a melee attack, the Rune Knight may expend an attack of opportunity to make an attack roll. If her attack roll is greater than the attacker’s, then she deflects the attack and that creature is unharmed.
		<br><br>
		This ability cannot allow a Rune Knight to move when she is otherwise restrained, weighed down, or unable to move. If the Rune Knight is unarmed, she can still use this ability, but takes the damage for a successful hit if she is successful.

		<br><br><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Crest </b>
		<br> At 3rd level, a Rune Knight chooses her first known Seal and makes it a permanent part of her Scribe Runes ability. However, this is more than a selection of power. 
		<br><br>
		The act of taking a Crest involves creating a design that shows the world who the Rune Knight is and what she stands for. It is up to the Rune Knight to select a design based around an animal or object to act as a Crest and coat-of-arms for herself and a sign of her protection. From this point on, any use of her Scribe Runes ability will cause this Crest’s design to display on the set of clothing or armor. 
		<br><br>
		The Rune Knight is known for standing against the evils of magic, but the Crest shows specifically what kind of magics the Rune Knight finds most deplorable.
		<br><br>
		See the next Ability on this list for available Seals.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Seal </b>
		<br> At 3rd level, a Rune Knight gains the experience needed to fine-tune her runes against a specific kind of magic. 
		<br><br>
		Each rune has two listed effects, a Defense effect and an Offense effect. At 3rd level, the Rune Knight learns to use her Scribe Rune ability on enemies as well as allies. 
		<br><br>
		When she uses her Scribe Rune ability on allies, she can choose one of her existing runes to apply in addition to her regular SR, granting them the effects of the seal she chose to use. 
		<br><br>
		When she uses her Scribe Rune ability on enemies, she can choose to grant them no SR, and instead simply apply the seal to them. She must succeed in an unarmed melee touch attack to deliver a seal to a foe in this way.
		<br><br>
		Below is a list of the seals available. When a creature is wearing a set of clothing or armor that bears a seal, it cannot be affected by or use any spells or spell-like abilities that have a descriptor matching the seal.
		<br><br>

		<div class="tableDiv" style="background-color: lightslategrey;">

				<tr><td>Air</td> <td>Acid</td> <td>Cold</td> <td>Fire</td> <td>Curse</td> </tr>
				<tr><td>Darkness(Shadow Included)</td> <td>Death</td> <td>Disease</td> <td>Draconic</td></tr>

		</div>
		<br><br>
		<p class="body-text">At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a Rune Knight may select another seal to add to their repertoire, though only one seal may be active at a time on a set of clothing or armor.</p>


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> No-Nonsense </b>
		<br> At 4th level, the Rune Knight has become such a solid and trustworthy individual that she exudes an aura that encourages bold honesty and discourages cowardice in all forms. The Rune Knight and all creatures within 10 feet of her gain a +2 bonus to sense motive and perception checks, and a -2 penalty to bluff, sleight of hand, and stealth checks.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Crested Armament </b>
		<br> At 5th level, a Rune Knight must make a choice. Will she choose to prioritize the destruction of magic or the protection against it? She learns to imbue an object with her Crest, either a weapon or a shield. She must choose one, and cannot learn the other. This choice cannot be changed once it is made. 
		<br> 
		<br><br><div class="classFeature"> 
			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Weapon</b>
			<br> You may carve your Crest upon a melee weapon of your choice. You may only ever have your Crest on a single weapon at a time, but can transfer the it to a new weapon by spending an hour of work. A weapon with your Crest gains the following effects:
			<br><b> -</b> The weapon gains a weapon bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier.
			<br><b> -</b> It is permanently engraved with your Crest, allowing you to choose to deliver your Crest’s Seal to a target as a part of a weapon attack with the weapon, instead of an unarmed touch attack.
			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Shield</b>
			<br> You may carve your Crest upon a shield of your choice. You may only ever have your Crest on a single shield at a time, but can transfer it to a new shield by spending an hour of work. A shield with your Crest gains the following effects:
			<br><b> -</b> The AC bonus of the shield is added to your current armor’s AC bonus, if that armor has runes inscribed on it. This counts for AC, SR, and Crit Guard calculations.
			<br><b> -</b> It is permanently engraved with your Crest, granting the effects of your Crest’s Seal to the wielder.
		</div>

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Disrupting Aura </b>
		<br> At 8th level, the Rune Knight has an exceptionally disruptive aura to spellcasters, her power and presence causing their hands to tremble and their minds to struggle. Any casters within 10 feet of the Rune Knight are considered threatened by her at all times and must cast defensively. This is true if the Rune Knight is alive, even if she is unarmed, unconscious, or bound.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Aura of Resolve </b>
		<br> At 11th level, a Rune Knight is immune to charm spells and spell-like abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against charm effects.
		<br><br>
		This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Spacial Lockdown </b>
		<br> At 14th level, a Rune Knight‘s presence is enough to alter the space around her. She emanates a 10 foot aura that locks the air, refusing to allow any teleportation or summoning effects to take place within the vicinity.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Arcane Lightning Rod </b>
		<br> At 17th level, a Rune Knight projects an aura of absolute magical protection about herself. Whenever a spell would target a creature within 10 feet of her, she may choose to force the spell to target her instead. If the spell would target her already, such as with an area-of-effect spell, she may choose to have it target her several times.
