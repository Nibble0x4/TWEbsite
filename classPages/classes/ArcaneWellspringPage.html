	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> The Arcane Wellspring </b>
	<br> After the fall of Camus and the fragmentation of the greatest collection of magical minds TWE has ever seen, the once-great University of Camus lies destitute. The people of Camus flee in fear of the bounty hunters, treasure hunters, mage killers, and bandits that flood the city. As the common people seek for places to hide in the countryside, they find peaceful forest glades and reassuring mountain caves in which to build new lives. With new settlements appearing, it falls to the few powerful wizards left to protect those around them. Some ex-students and ex-professors alike are forced to wrack their brains for ways to extend their magic. They can create fog clouds to obscure their glades and they can construct stone walls to protect them, but all of these spells last for mere minutes. They needed ways to make their magic last. In this unsure time, a new way of magic was discovered. Casting aside the time-sensitive battle-casting mindset of their posh past, the Arcane Wellspring arose as a class of wizards who twist spell into ritual. These beacons of hope spread their magic over their allies like a safety blanket, ensuring that as long as they still stand, their communities will not fall to outsiders.

	<br><br><b>Role</b>: Arcane Wellsprings function as a long-term support class. Wellsprings overflow with limitless magical potential, but they are not fast. They must spend several minutes at a time to cast their stronger spells, leaving them extremely vulnerable in combat. However, their rituals last for hours and even days, allowing them to maintain powerful effects far longer and far more freely than other casters.

	<br><br> 

		<hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader">Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>
		<br> An Arcane Wellspring is proficient with simple weapons. See weapon lists <a href="../../resourcePages/weaponsAndArmor/WeaponPage.html">HERE</a>.
		<br> They are not proficient with any armor, as it interferes with their concentration.

		<br><br>
		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Spellcasting"> Spellcasting </b>
		<br> The Arcane Wellspring casts spells in a similar manner to a wizard. His <b>primary casting ability is Intelligence</b>. 
		<br> He casts arcane spells drawn from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-sorcerer-and-wizard">sorcerer/wizard spell list</a>. In addition to this list, he also has access to a unique spell list <a href="arcaneWellspringSubPages/ArcaneWellspringUniqueSpellList.html">Here</a>.
		<br> Like a wizard, he possesses a spellbook, a tome that contains details on the magical spells he knows. He can only cast a spell if he has an Intelligence score equal to or greater than 10 + the level of the spell. 
		<br> An Arcane Wellspring's spellbook may contain any number of spells, and he can even copy spells from other spellbooks if he is given enough time to do so.
		<br><br> Unlike a wizard, an Arcane Wellspring <b>does not have spell slots per day</b>. He can cast as many of the spells he knows as he would like each day, provided the spell is in his spellbook and he has a chance to consult the book.
		<br>
		<br> <b><u>Starting Spells:</u></b> He begins play with 3 cantrips in his spellbook, plus an additional number of cantrips equal to his Intelligence modifier. He also begins play with 3 1st-level spells, plus an additional number of 1st-level spells equal to his Intelligence modifier.
		<br> <b><u>Spells Gained at a New Level:</u></b> Arcane Wellspring's can add 2 new spells of their choice to their spellbook, provided they can cast them. 

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Ritual-Casting"> Ritual Casting </b>
		<br> The Arcane Wellspring casts spells in a very different way from traditional casters. Every spell they can cast, aside from Cantrips, is cast as a ritual. This means that each cast of a spell that is above level 0 takes 10 minutes to perform.
		<br> When he casts spells in this way, he may choose to change the Duration on the spell. Below is a chart depicting the new durations, should he choose to change them with this ability.

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Concentration"> Concentration </b>
		<br> Nearly all casters are familiar with the idea of concentration, but the Arcane Wellspring has a deeper reliance upon it than any other. Spellcasters cannot maintain concentration on more than one spell at a time. This means that, if they currently are maintaining a spell with a duration reliant on Concentration, then they cannot cast another such spell without ending the first.
		<br><br> When an Arcane Wellspring casts a spell with a duration of Concentration, or when they use their Ritual Casting ability to change the duration of a spell, they fill one of their Concentration Slots. This allows them to maintain Concentration on more than one spell at a time. When they end Concentration on a spell, that slot is freed for use once again.  
		<br><br> If an Arcane Wellspring goes unconscious or has their Intelligence reduced to a value too low to cast a spell, they lose concentration on all spells and all of their slots are freed.

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Expanded-Mind"> Expanded Mind </b>
		<br> The Arcane Wellspring can maintain concentration on more than a single spell at a time. The number of spells they can maintain concentration on is shown on the <a href="#class-table">class table</a>.

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Cantrips"> Cantrips </b>
		<br> While nearly all his magic is ritualistic, there remain yet a few spells that the Arcane Wellspring can rely on if he needs to act quickly. These spells are 0th-level spells called Cantrips. They do not take spell slots to cast, and can be cast as many times per day as the Arcane Wellspring desires. 
		<br><br> Casting a Cantrip takes 1 action. 

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Arcane-Bond"> Arcane Bond </b>
		<br> At 1st level, wizards form a powerful bond with an object or a creature. This bond can take one of two forms: a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/familiar">familiar</a> or a bonded object. A familiar is a magical pet that enhances the wizardâ€™s skills and senses and can aid him in magic, while a bonded object is an item a wizard can use
		<br><br> Rules for familiars are located here: <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard/familiar">Familiars</a>.
		<br><br> Rules for bonded items are located here: <a href="arcaneWellspringSubPages/BondedItemRulesPage.html">Bonded Items</a>.

		

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Serenity"> Serenity </b>
		<br> At 2nd Level, an Arcane Wellspring's focus intensifies, helping them with their concentration.
		<br><br> He gains a +1 bonus to Concentration checks. He gains an additional +1 to Concentration at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter. 


	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Ritual-Creation"> Ritual Creation </b>
		<br> At 2nd Level, an Arcane Wellspring is familiar enough with ritual casting to begin to experiment on his own. He may spend time and effort to create his very own ritual spells, much like a wizard might create their own spells. 
		<br><br> The time and specific requirements of creating a ritual spell will vary based on the ritual itself and the prerogative of the GM, but in general you can find the rules for spell creation here.

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Storage"> Storage </b>
		<br> At 3rd Level, an Arcane Wellspring learns that, in battle, it pays to be prepared. He can, after spending the time to perform a ritual cast for a spell with a duration of 'Instantaneous,' choose to store that spell in his body instead of going off. If he does, he may later spend a swift action on his turn to release the spell as if he had just cast it. Once he does this, the stored spell is spent.
		<br><br> In addition, if the spell he has stored is an elemental damaging spell, then he may add bonus elemental damage to his melee attacks equal to the level of the spell he has stored for as long as it remains in him.
		<br><br> At 8th, 16th, and 20th levels, the number of spells an Arcane Wellspring can store increases by 1 to a maximum of 4. Only one spell can be released in a turn, regardless of how many are stored. The damage bonus from elemental spells does not increase if multiple elemental damage spells are stored.
		<br><br> At 12th level, The Arcane Wellspring can extend his power to others, storing spells in them instead of himself. If he does so, the spell can be released on their command, not the Wellspring's. If the Wellspring is knocked unconscious or otherwise is unable to maintain concentration, then those stored spells are lost.

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Center"> Center </b>
		<br> At 4th Level, an Arcane Wellspring can twist his magic such that it follows him wherever he goes. When he casts a spell with an area of effect that includes himself, he may choose to allow the area to move with him, so long as the effect persists.

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Tether"> Tether </b>
		<br> At 5th Level, an Arcane Wellspring becomes a cornerstone for allied spellcasters, always there in case they need support. When an ally within 15 feet of him would fail a concentration check, he may choose to attempt the check himself. If the Arcane Wellspring succeeds on the check, he may expend 1 concentration to allow his ally to instead succeed on the check. 
		<br><br> If he does this, then the concentration slot he expended will be considered filled for the rest of the day and cannot be released.

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Community"> Community </b>
		<br> At 6th Level, an Arcane Wellspring expands his mind and his concept of 'self.' From his new perspective, he may treat all spells with a range of 'Personal' to instead be 'Creature touched.' 

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Ritual-Fusion"> Ritual Fusion </b>
		<br> At 7th Level, an Arcane Wellspring sees his rituals as building blocks, ready to be used for something bigger, something grander that only he can see. When he would cast 2 rituals, he may instead choose to attempt to combine the effects of the spells into something entirely new. Doing so requires a <b>Spellcraft check with a DC of 15 + twice the sum of the spell levels of the two spells being combined</b>.
		<br><br> If he succeeds on the check, then an entirely new effect is produced based on the unique combination of the two spells used, filling only a single concentration slot. Neither of these spells can be cast again until the combined effect ends. If he fails, then he must choose one of the spells used. This spell cannot be cast again for the rest of the day.

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Control"> Control </b>
		<br> At 10th Level, An Arcane Wellspring has learned to twist their spells carefully, controlling who and what is affected. When he casts a spell affecting an area, he may choose to exclude a number of creatures or objects equal to his Intelligence modifier.

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Overflow"> Overflow </b>
		<br> At 13th Level, An Arcane Wellspring's magic is too much to contain in his body. He provides a powerful bonus to all allies (excluding himself) within 10 feet. All allies affected by his Overflow receive a bonus to a save of the Wellspring's choice equal to his Intelligence modifier. This bonus can be changed, but doing so requires a full-round action on the part of the Wellspring.
		<br><br> At 15th Level, he may expand his choices to give a bonus to 2 of the following: reflex saves, will saves, fortitude saves, or Caster Level.
		<br><br> At 17th Level, he may expand his choices to give a bonus to 3 of the following: reflex saves, will saves, fortitude saves, Caster Level, or Base Attack Bonus.


	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="capstone"> Capstone... </b>
		<br> This is the Capstone ability for a Arcane Wellspring!
		<br><br> There is no one-size-fits-all capstone for every Arcane Wellspring, so work with your GM to see what masterful ability you might unlock!
