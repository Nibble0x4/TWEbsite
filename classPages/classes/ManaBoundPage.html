	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> The ManaBound </b>
	<br> In TWE, there exists a type of warrior that dedicates their life to the pursuit of raw, destructive power. These people embrace magic as the ultimate source of power, but refuse to spend their days locked in a tower, studying spells while their bodies waste away. Instead, these people become students of Mana. In the Tri-Villages of Taria, an entire village known as Werta is devoted to the mastery of this special brand of magic. Students of Mana learn to call upon the power of the world around them without losing the chance to train their bodies physically. They become bound to Mana, and they wield it alongside their bodies to inflict maximum destruction.

	<br><br><b>Role</b>: The Manabound are a combat-centric class. They are decently effective fist fighters with the toughness to go toe-to-toe with melee warriors, but their main draw is the mana they can use to cast their special elemental spells, called Tacs. They regenerate a little mana each round, so they can feel free to throw out attacks without worrying about spell slots or any such silliness.

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Class Features </b>
	<br> 
	<br><br> 

		<hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader">Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>
		<br> A Manabound is proficient with no weapons and with light armor, though they still do take the arcane Tac failure chance for wearing armor. See weapon lists <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons#simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons">HERE</a>. See Armor lists <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/armor">HERE</a>.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Bound to Mana </b>
		<br> A Manabound performs a ritual at level 1 that binds them irreversibly to Mana, a combination of aether and human energy. This ritual gives them the ability to harness mana, but locks them out of ever forming a connection with another kind of magic. Manabound cannot take levels in other magical classes, unless they give up all magic abilities from that class. Similarly, anyone who becomes Manabound loses all magical abilities and spells they have gained from other classes or even their race.
		<br><br>
		In return, the power of mana fills them, providing an overflowing fountain of renewing magical energy that they can wield at will.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> ManaFist Destiny </b>
		<br> The Manabound are Tac-casters, wielders of magic, but they are not the kind to shy away from danger. To the contrary, Manabound are trained specifically in the use of their bodies as weapons, eschewing other kinds of weapons and relying on their own strength. As a result, Manabound are never truly unarmed even if they run out of mana.
		<br><br>
		At first level, the Manabound gains the Improved Unarmed Strike feat. In addition, they are considered to have proficiency with no other weapons and their Manabound Base Attack Bonus is considered to be ½ of their Manabound level when wielding any such weapons.
		<br><br>
		In addition, the Manabound learns the basic Tac from each element. See the “Tac List” section to find them.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Mana Pool </b>
		<br> The Manabound gains a pool of mana at first level. This pool contains a number of points equal to their constitution modifier. 
		<br><br> This pool is the source of their magic, and refills automatically. Every 6 seconds, the Manabound gains 1 point of mana in their pool. In addition, they can spend a single action on their turn to regain 1 point of mana.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Tacs </b>
		<br> Manabound have a rather restricted Tac list, the result of wielding such unrestricted magic. They gain a small number of Tacs as they grow stronger, so their choices of Tac matter greatly. 
		<br><br>
		At every even level, a Manabound mage learns 1 new Tac and each known Tac gains 1 rank. A new Tac learned can be used at will, provided the mage has enough mana to cast it. New Tacs are learned at Tac rank equal to your mage rank.
		<br><br>
		A Tac rank is essentially a power boost to a learned Tac that shows how much more skilled a mage has become at wielding their magic. Each Tac has a listed “Rankup Effect” (see the “Tac List” section for examples) that takes effect every time a Tac receives a rankup. 
		<br><br>
		Not every Tac in the Manabound list utilizes a DC, but here is the calculation for DCs.
		<br><b> Tac DC = 8 + constitution modifier</b>
		<br><br><i>Detached:</i> This paragraph contains rules that apply ONLY to Detached mages. When a Detached mage learns a new Tac, they are not restricted to choosing Tacs from any particular elements. In addition, the new Tacs they learn are learned at Tac rank 1.
		<br><br> See the “Tac List” for reference on the Manabound Tacs.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Elemental Attunement </b>
		<div class="classFeature">
			<br> Each Manabound wields the power of the elements, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have favorites. As they grow in power and experience, the Manabound has a choice to attune themselves to different elements. When they do so, they become stronger in the use of their chosen element but unable to use any others. 
			<br><br> 
			When a Manabound mage chooses an attunement, they lose all of the basic Tacs from elements not included within their attunements. The basic Tacs of their remaining elements are boosted one rank. From that point on, mages can only select Tacs from within their attunement. 

			<br><br><b class="fireSubHeader">Passion- Fire/Force</b>
			<br> Fire is rampant and destructive, with little restraint. Fire Tacs focus on destroying their target and anything else that happens to be nearby with ferocity and burning power. 
			<br>
			Force is an oft-overlooked element, but is the truest weapon that mana can produce. Force Tacs focus on striking their target regardless of protection, even if that comes at the cost of power. 
			<br>
			Mages choosing this attunement tend to be fierce and confident, taking down hordes and individuals without breaking a sweat.
			<br><br> You can find a Tac List with the Passion Tacs <a href="manaboundSubPages/ManaBoundTacListPassion.html">HERE</a>.

			<br><br><b class="waterSubHeader">Serenity- Water/Ice</b>
			<br> Water is beautiful but deceptively strong, and water Tacs focus on pushing and pulling friends and foes around the battle, keeping enemies constantly off-balance. 
			<br>
			Ice is similar to water in its beauty, but is far more severe in its methods. Ice Tacs focus on wearing down opponents, slowing them, weakening them, and stealing their will to fight. 
			<br>
			Mages choosing this attunement tend to be patient and calm, but severe, always in control.
			<br><br> You can find a Tac List with the Serenity Tacs <a href="manaboundSubPages/ManaBoundTacListSerenity.html">HERE</a>.

			<br><br><b class="earthSubHeader">Patience- Earth/Acid</b>
			<br> Earth is strong and unyielding, giving way to nothing. Earth Tacs are powerful when they strike, crushing their targets under unforgiving stone attacks. 
			<br>
			Acid is the bane of earth, causing all defenses to crumble under its touch. Acid Tacs focus on breaking down the resistance of its targets before it allows them to finally die.  
			<br>
			Mages choosing this attunement tend to be firm and unyielding, planning out the best time to strike.
			<br><br> You can find a Tac List with the Patience Tacs <a href="manaboundSubPages/ManaBoundTacListPatience.html">HERE</a>.

			<br><br><b class="windSubHeader">Decision- Wind/Electricity</b>
			<br> Wind is swift and evasive, moving wherever it wishes with little thought or worry of being stopped. Wind Tacs emphasize speed and movement, especially when attacking.  
			<br>
			Lightning is the perfect complement of wind, arcing through the air to strike down its foes. Lightning Tacs focus on dealing high damage to creatures below them and even occasionally arcing between targets. 
			<br>
			Mages choosing this attunement tend to be quick in mind and body, surprising their foes and keeping them on their toes.
			<br><br> You can find a Tac List with the Decision Tacs <a href="manaboundSubPages/ManaBoundTacListDecision.html">HERE</a>.

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Detached</b>
			<br> Any mage who chooses this option eschews the power offered by the individual elements, instead choosing not to give up any of their basic Tacs. 
			<br>
			These mages gain no Exclusive Tacs from their attunement, as they have not attuned to anything, but instead have different rules governing Tac selection (see the “Tacs” section). 
			<br>
			Mages choosing to remain detached tend to be individualistic and clever, using creative tactics to solve problems in ways that no attuned mage ever could.

		</div>

			<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Attunement Resistance </b>
		<br> The Manabound gains the ability to resist the elements of their attunement as they grow stronger. 
		<br><br> At 5th level, the Manabound resists the energy type damage associated with their attunement with a resistance equal to <b> their Manabound Level</b>
		<br><b>Passion</b> resists Fire.
		<br><b>Serenity</b> resists Cold.
		<br><b>Patience</b> resists Acid.
		<br><b>Decision</b> resists Electric.
		<br><br> At 11th level, all damage of the resisted type is cut in half (rounded down) before being reduced by their resistance.
		<br><br> At 17th level, the ManaBound is immune to damage from their respective type.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Tac List </b>
			<br> All Tacs are classified based on their elemental Attunement. Here are the different Tac Lists.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Tac Effect List </b>
		<div class="classFeature">
		<br> Some Tacs grant effects and impairments that are not often, if ever, seen otherwise. Here is a guide to those effects: 

		<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Vulnerability X (Y)</b>
			<br> This effect causes you to take additional damage X from a particular source Y. For example, if you have Vulnerability 7 (P), you take extra damage from Piercing. If you are struck by a 15 damage strike, you take 15+7=22 Piercing damage. If you are struck by 5 damage, you take only 5+5=10 Piercing damage.
			<br>

		<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Inflamed X</b>
			<br> This effect causes you to take fire damage at the start of your turn, every turn until you douse it by spending an action to do so or by other methods such as water. The default damage for this effect when caused by a Fire Tac is 1d4+(X).
			<br>

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Steam Power X</b>
			<br> This effect causes you to release heat stored in your body when using a Water Tac. For every 5 feet the Tac would push the target, deal X points of fire damage instead.
			<br>

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Jolted</b>
			<br> This effect causes your body to lock up, limiting your ability to react to sudden dangers. You have disadvantage on saving throws.
