	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> The Specialist </b>
	<br> There are some among us who are destined for greatness. Whether they be born into powerful bloodlines, inherent masters of the arcane powers around us, or scions of the very gods who rule over our world, these people have power that normal people cannot hope to attain. Many try, and they fall short. However, there are those who do not even try to play with the alluring powers of magic. Among these, there exist some who use experience and a keen mind to go where no normal person could go. They do what even the occult masters of nature, the druidic circles, struggle to accomplish. They become true masters of their art. While these Specialists start out with a respectable skillset, that is nothing compared to what they can become once they find their true calling. Once they do, then even those born with power must watch their step. To those with magic, the impossible is possible. To those with dedication and a clear path, the impossible has already been done.

	<br><br><b>Role</b>: Specialists are masters of the wild. While they are not in touch with the magic of the natural world, nor do they worship it, they can move through it in ways unrivaled by all but the mysterious druids. They are hardy warriors who use their experience, quick minds, and quicker blades to survive. Once they have selected their path, however, they become a force to be reckoned with that can often lead a party down their path with them, whether they like it or not.

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Class Features </b>
	<br> 
	<br><br> 
		

		<hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader">Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>
		<br> A Specialist is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor and shields (except tower shields). See weapon lists <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons#simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons">HERE</a>. See Armor lists <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/armor">HERE</a>.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Favored Enemy </b>
		<br> At 1st level, a Specialist selects a creature type from the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#Ranger-Favored-Enemies-Table">ranger favored enemies table</a>. She gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of his selected type. Likewise, she gets a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. A Specialist may make Knowledge skill checks untrained when attempting to identify these creatures.
		<br> <br>
		At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the Specialist may select an additional favored enemy. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.
		If the Specialist chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, she must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table below. (Note that there are other types of humanoid to choose from—those called out specifically on the table below are merely the most common.) If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the Specialist’s bonuses do not stack; she simply uses whichever bonus is higher.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Track </b>
		<br> A Specialist adds half her level (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks made to follow tracks.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Wild Empathy </b>
		<br> A Specialist can improve the initial attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see Using Skills). The Specialist rolls 1d20 and adds her Specialist level and her Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.
		<br><br>
		To use wild empathy, the Specialist and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.
		<br><br>
		The Specialist can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Pet </b>
		<br> A Specialist is close to the natural world, despite their lack of magical affinity. At 1st level, the Specialist gains a familiar similarly to the way a wizard does. This creature can be of any mundane creature type acceptable to the gm and reasonable for the region. However, any and all magical abilities or uses of the familiar are not available to the Specialist. He can speak to his familiar, but in every other way it is considered to be a non-magical creature. It will be noticeable, upon use of detect magic, that the magic within the Specialist’s pet is so dormant that it has almost ceased to exist. The pet may have a mind of its own, or it may not. However, it is not typically useful in combat, rather serving as a pleasant companion to the Specialist on her often lonely journeys. 

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Combat Style </b>
		<br> A Specialist can, at second level, choose to take a <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger/ranger-combat-styles/">combat style</a>. She will gain a combat style feat at this level and advance in her style identically to how a ranger advances in his. If she chooses this option, then she may choose another feat from her chosen combat style at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels.
		<br><br>
			If the specialist does not choose to take a combat style, then she can instead choose to select the Hunting Party Ability.

		<br><br><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Hunting Party </b>
		<br> A Specialist has trained themselves extensively in the art of team-oriented combat. They may, as a single action, choose to call out a signal to their party. If this is not the Specialist’s first time fighting alongside these allies, then all allies within 60 feet of the Specialist gain ½ the bonus granted by her applicable Favored Enemy bonus. (This also applies with the Defensive Tactician’s expanded Favored Enemy uses.) In addition, the party gains an intrinsic understanding of the enemy’s weaknesses and how to exploit them. They gain a bonus multiplier on exploited known weaknesses equal to ½ the boosted value that the Specialist herself currently gains.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Endurance </b>
		<br> A Specialist gains <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/endurance">Endurance</a> as a bonus feat at 3rd level.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Favored Terrain </b>
		<br> At 3rd level, a Specialist may select a type of terrain from <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/Core-Classes/ranger/#TOC-Favored-Terrain-Ex-">Table: Ranger Favored Terrains</a>. The Specialist gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography),(Local),(Nature), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks when she is in this terrain. A Specialist traveling through her favored terrain normally leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (though she may leave a trail if she so chooses).
		<br><br>
		At 8th level and every five levels thereafter, the Specialist may select an additional favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired), increases by +2.
		<br><br>
		If a specific terrain falls into more than one category of favored terrain, the Specialist’s bonuses do not stack; she simply uses whichever bonus is higher.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Calling </b>
		<br> At 4th level, the Specialist is experienced enough to realize her true calling. If she is to be truly great, she must choose her path carefully. Her skills are varied, but it is time for her to choose what her specialty will be. This choice will define her for the rest of her adventures. This choice is not to be made lightly.
		<br><br>
		The Specialist has 4 options to choose from. She must make her choice before she can advance to 5th level, though she mustn’t choose immediately upon reaching 4th level if she needs more time to think. Once chosen, her selection cannot be changed.
		<br><br>

		<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader"> The Path of the Trapper </b>
		<div class="classFeature"> This is the path for those who prepare. The Trapper is an expert in analysis. They track and hunt their quarry with care, leaving nothing to chance. The Trapper gains the following abilities:
			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">4th Level: Traps</b>
			<br> At this level, the Trapper gains the <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ROGUE/#TOC-Trapfinding">trapfinding</a> and <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ROGUE/#TOC-Trap-Sense-Ex-">trap sense</a> abilities, using her Specialist level as her rogue level. She also adds the disable device skill to her list of class skills. If she already has that skill trained, then she adds a +3 miscellaneous modifier to that skill instead. 
			<br><br>
			She can now create and use traps from the following <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger/archetypes/paizo-ranger-archetypes/trapper/ranger-traps">Trap List</a>. She must have all the proper material components and time required to sensibly construct such a trap. If the trap is magical in nature, then she must have the required magical components or some feasible way of recreating said components in a mundane way. She adds +½ her highest favored enemy bonus to the DCs of her traps (if the trap is used on a favored enemy, you may also use that favored enemy bonus, if it is higher than half your highest). Her damage when using traps is equal to [½ her Specialist level D6]. This damage is applied to any creature that activates her trap unless she announces her trap to be non-damaging during the creation process.

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">8th Level: Special Traps</b>
			<br> At this level, the Trapper gains the ability to design and implement traps of her own. This is done in conjunction with the DM, and uses any materials, magic, moving parts, environment, allies, or any other feasible component in the crafting of the trap. It can be designed for specific enemies or general use. 
			<br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">ALSO 8th Level: Forage</b>
			<br> The Trapper is now familiar with various haphazard implementations of traps. She recognizes that not all traps require pristine materials, and thus learns to glean objects from nature for use in her traps. She can use her track class feature to locate specific materials for a trap she has in mind. Depending on what she finds, these materials may apply a penalty or a failure chance but can be used to successfully craft a trap. 

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">12th Level: Large Trap</b>
			<br>  At this level, the Trapper has mastered the creation of traps and no longer must adhere to the typical size. Instead of taking up a 5-foot square, the Trapper can now choose to make traps that range in dimension from 1-foot to 15-foot in each dimension. (Thus, anywhere from 1x1 to 10x5 to 15x15 are correct sizes). 

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">16th Level: Swift and Deadly Trap</b>
			<br>  At this level, the Trapper has become very swift at constructing and designing their traps. They can now cut the time required to do both tasks in half. In addition, they can now use their full Specialist level to determine the damage dealt by their traps, [their level d6 damage].

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">20th Level: Limitless Trap</b>
			<br>  At this level, the Trapper can now create traps of unbounded size. No creature is safe. As long as she has time and material enough, she can create a trap for any target. Beware the Trapper, for she doesn’t need to come for you. She will see to it that you come right to her.
		</div>

		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader"> The Path of the Beastmaster </b>
		<div class="classFeature"> This is the path for those who do not wish to walk alone. People are acceptable, but there is no true company but that of the beasts. To the Beastmaster, the wild and the bestial are the best companions. The Beastmaster walks a wild road, and there are none who know such paths better than the creatures who live there. The Beastmaster gains the following abilities:
			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">4th Level: Temporary Ally</b>
			<br> At this level, the Beastmaster can reach out to the native creatures of his favored terrain to assist him in his adventures. Whether to hunt an unbalancing beast or seek out a corrupting curse, the Beastmaster can appeal to the native creatures to aid him in his quest. The Beastmaster can use his track class feature to locate wild creatures within his favored terrain that he is aware of. Upon locating such creatures, he can use his wild empathy ability to commune with them. If he successfully manages to make such creatures consider him a friend, then he can have them assist him as long as he is in the favored terrain and within the usual boundaries of that creature’s habitat. He can have a number of temporary allies up to ½ his Specialist level follow him at once. (Some creatures such as particularly large or small creatures may count as more or less than 1 creature for the purposes of calculating this total). The temporary allies will leave you if you finish the task you set for them or when you dismiss them. They may also leave you if they feel threatened by the presence of other beasts or people. They do not want to die, so a temporary ally who is reduced to low health is likely to flee instead of fight to the death. The Beastmaster’s pet is not considered a temporary ally.

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">8th Level: Friends</b>
			<br> At this level, the Beastmaster becomes almost as one of the beasts. They see him not as a human master, but as a member of their pack or in some way a friend to them. Once per day, when a Beastmaster would dismiss his temporary ally, he may use his wild empathy to attempt to befriend his ally. If he is successful, then that ally becomes his Friend. He may have at any time a maximum number of Friends equal to ¼ his Specialist level. A Friend who is not traveling with the Beastmaster does not count towards this total. 
			<br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">ALSO 8th Level: Combat Friend</b>
			<br> The Beastmaster’s Friends are not all of the predatory and combative type, of course. However, for those who are, it is often likely that such creatures are loathe to leave their habitat. Friends who fall under this category are called Combat Friends, and they do not follow you outside of their habitat. However, they are still your Friend and you can call for them when you return. If they are able, they will answer your call and come to your aid.

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">12th Level: Team</b>
			<br>  At this level, your animals have begun to understand your ways. You have fought with them and they have learned from you. Your Friends now gain your same favored enemies, but only receive half of your bonuses. If you selected the Hunting Party ability instead of a combat style, then they receive your whole bonus and your temporary allies receive half of your bonus while traveling with you.

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">16th Level: Team</b>
			<br>  At this level, your movements communicate more than any human could perceive. To your creatures, your very posture is communication. They no longer require much effort to guide. You may now instruct your animals without spending even a single action. 

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">20th Level: King of the Beasts</b>
			<br>  Are you a man or a beast? Unknown. The people see you as a man, but the beasts see you as one of them. To both, however, one thing is clear: You are the Alpha. You can now have a number of Friends equal to ½ your Specialist level. In addition, you gain a bonus of ½ your Specialist level on uses of wild empathy. 
		</div>

		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader"> The Path of the Herbalist </b>
		<div class="classFeature"> This is the path for those who care. The wild is a harsh and unforgiving place to most, but some have mastered it in order to not only dominate it, but to help others thrive in it as well. These people are more interested in the land itself and what it gives than they are in the beasts that inhabit it. The Herbalist gains the following abilities:
			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">4th Level: Cook</b>
			<br> At this level, the Herbalist learns the value of consuming the boons of nature. Each morning, or during rest periods of 4 hours or more, the Herbalist may spend her time cooking a nutritious meal for herself and any others she wishes to aid. (She may prepare a meal for up to 8 people in 4 hours. For each additional hour she works, she can prepare a meal for 4 more people, provided she has enough resources.) This meal grants day-long bonuses according to the kind of dish that was prepared. If a creature eats a new Herbalist meal, the effects from previous meals are removed. The Herbalist does this using resources from the environment around her or from her own stores. The Herbalist has freedom of creative expression when devising her dish, but here are the basic options available to all Herbalists:
			<br><br><b> Hearty Hash</b>: Creatures gain a number of bonus hp equal to twice your level. These are lost first. Creatures can only stomach one of these meals each day.
			<br><br><b> Champion Chowder</b>: Creatures gain a +2 bonus on melee damage rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 Specialist levels you have.
			<br><br><b> Keen Kimchi</b>: Creatures gain a +2 bonus on melee attack rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 Specialist levels you have.
			<br><br><b> Steady Salad</b>: Creatures gain a +2 bonus on ranged damage rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 Specialist levels you have.
			<br><br><b> Precise Pizza</b>: Creatures gain a +2 bonus on ranged attack rolls. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 Specialist levels you have.
			<br><br><b> Focused Flan</b>: Creatures gain a +2 bonus on skill checks that increases by +1 for every 2 Specialist levels you have. This bonus applies to each consumer differently. Each consumer can choose 3 skills that they would like to apply this bonus to when they consume the flan.
			<br><br><b> Sturdy Stew</b>: Creatures gain a +2 bonus to their crit guard. This bonus increases by +1 for every 2 Specialist levels you have.
			<br><br><b> Macho Mash</b>: Creatures gain a +2 bonus to their CMD and CMB. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 Specialist levels you have. 
			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">ALSO 4th Level: Emergency Aid</b>
			<br> The Herbalist knows all too well the dangers of the wild, so she never goes anywhere without a bottle of her handcrafted healing potion. She gains the Skill Focus (Heal) feat. In addition, each morning when she cooks, she may roll a survival check (DC 10). If she succeeds, she creates a healing brew that restores a number of hp equal to [1d6 for every 2 Specialist levels she possesses, + her Specialist level]. For every 4 that she surpasses the DC, she may prepare 1 additional dose. At the end of each day, half of the Herbalist’s Emergency Aid potions expire (rounding down). 

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">8th Level: Poultice</b>
			<br> At this level, the Herbalist realizes that the balance of nature can be used to their benefit. For every burden, nature has a counter-balance. For every affliction, there is a cure for those keen enough to find it. The Herbalist can find these cures, given she has access to the correct materials. During her cooking time, she can also choose to use gathered materials to craft soothing poultices. These items can be used with a successful heal check (DC equal to the DC of the affliction) by the Herbalist as a single action on herself or an ally within range. Each morning, she can create a number of poultices equal to her wisdom modifier. These poultices come in two forms:
			<br><b class="classFeatureSubheader1">Specific Poultice</b>
			<br> These poultices are fast-acting and effective. They take effect within seconds, curing the ailment at the start of the creature’s next turn. However, they must be made with a specific ailment in mind. (e.g. poison, stunned, paralyzed). 
			<br><b class="classFeatureSubheader1">General Poultice</b>
			<br> These poultices are slower to act, but much more reliable. They also are applied quickly, but can take upwards of an hour to bring refreshment, depending on the severity of the affliction. Unlike the Specific Poultice, these do not require a specific affliction to be announced when they are made.
			<br><br> The Herbalist chooses what poultices to make when she creates them. They become inert 24 hours from their creation.

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">12th Level: Dynamic Cuisine</b>
			<br>  At this level, the Herbalist learns to harness the nutritional value of either breakfast or lunch, depending on which meal they like better. When she cooks a meal during the morning or midday, respectively, she may choose two dishes and merge their effects into one delicious feast. Creatures cannot stomach more than a single such feast per day.

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">16th Level: Medicinal Master</b>
			<br>  At this level, the Herbalist masters the art of medicinal mixing. She may now make a number of poultices per day equal to twice her wisdom modifier. In addition, she can choose to place any of those created poultices into one of her created potions. This destroys the poultice, but transfers its effects into the potion. The potion now heals hp in addition to whatever effect the poultice grants. 

			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">20th Level: Miracle Worker</b>
			<br>  At this level, the Herbalist’s hands bring succor and strength to all. Whenever she cooks, she can infuse her meals with the effects of two different dishes without making it any more difficult to consume than a normal meal. When she creates a feast during her favorite meal, she can instead choose three different dish effects. In addition, her handcrafted potions now heal using d8 instead of d6.
		</div>

		<p class="body-text"><br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader"> The Path of the Defensive Tactician </b>
		<div class="classFeature"> This is the path for those who survive. While the other paths specialize in different skills, the Defensive Tactician recognizes that he has already learned all he needs. His mind is sharp, and he knows that is the key to defeating any target and hunting any prey. While it is important to know how to strike your quarry and kill it, it is foolish to forget that your prey can do the same. The Defensive Tactician takes his knowledge of his favorite targets and extends it. He studies their attack patterns and strengths, not just their weaknesses. As a result, he can protect himself while hunting. After all, what use is a keen blade in the hand of a dead man? 
		<br><br> The Defensive Tactician operates differently from the other paths. He does not learn new abilities as he grows, for he has all that he needs. Instead, the only thing that grows is his mastery of the skills he has. At the point where he takes this path, he gains the ability to apply his favored enemy bonus to his AC, CMB, and CMD when fighting said creatures, and he adds ½ his favored enemy bonus to his saving throws against such enemies. In addition, his favored enemy bonus is now +3 instead of +2. For the sake of all abilities and conditions that reference his favored enemy bonus, it is considered to apply in this way. If others gain his bonuses, they gain it in this way. 
			<br><br><b class="classFeatureSubheader">Universal Distaste</b>
			<br> A Defensive Tactician recognizes that he is outclassed in scenarios where he cannot face his favored enemy. Not to be caught off-guard, the Defensive Tactician learns to find aspects of all enemies to hate. When in combat against an enemy who isn’t a favored enemy, he can choose to spend 3 actions to observe his opponent. He must be able to see his target, and he must be in combat with it in order to successfully use this ability. If he is successful, he may treat this target (and only this target) as a favored enemy for up to 1 minute per Specialist level. His bonuses against this enemy are equal to the bonuses that he gets against a brand-new selected favored enemy (+3).

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Exploit Weakness </b>
		<br> At 5th level, and at every 5 levels thereafter, the Specialist gains an increased ability to target and utilize her opponent’s weaknesses. When she discovers a weakness (such as an elemental weakness to fire) in her opponent, the Specialist increases the multiplier of that weakness by +.5x (this increases by +.5x for every 5 levels after 5th) when the Specialist is rolling for damage against that target. This does not change the weakness multiplier of the target permanently, nor does anyone else get the opportunity to take advantage of this increased weakness. It is solely a result of the Specialist’s trained eye and combat experience.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Woodland Stride </b>
		<br> Starting at 7th level, a Specialist may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.
		<br>
		Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Prepare the Land </b>
		<br> At 7th level, while the Specialist is in her favored terrain, she may spend an hour to prepare a section of land. This land can then be used for the following uses:
		<br><br><b> Camp</b>: Any camp she sets in this land can be hidden. Roll a disguise check to make your camp harder to locate. In addition, you are more likely to hear enemies coming and your party gains +4 on initiative rolls when beginning combat in the camp.
		<br><br><b> Ambush</b>: If she chooses to set an ambush, then her whole party gains a bonus to their stealth checks equal to her Specialist level. In addition, her party gains a +8 bonus on initiative rolls when the battle begins. If her ambush is successful, then she gets to treat all the creatures in her ambush as favored enemies (with the bonus for a brand new favored enemy).
		<br><br><b> Defense</b>: She can choose to fortify the land for defense. If she does so, then her whole party gains +4 on initiative rolls and begins combat with total cover. In addition, she gets to treat all the creatures in the attack as favored enemies (with the bonus for a brand new favored enemy).
		<br><br><b> Track</b>: If any creature passes through this prepared land, then she gains a bonus on her track equal to her level+the number of allies who helped her prepare it (max+5). 
		<br><br><b> Trap</b>: If the Specialist is a Trapper, then any traps triggered on land prepared in this way are guaranteed a critical hit (multiplier x4) on any creature who fails the save against it. 
		<br><br><b> Other Uses</b>: Get creative! The Specialist may find other uses than this one. If she does, she may pitch it to the GM. 

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Swift Tracker </b>
		<br> Beginning at 8th level, a Specialist can move at her normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal –5 penalty. She takes only a –10 penalty (instead of the normal –20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Evasion </b>
		<br> When she reaches 9th level, a Specialist can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the Specialist is wearing light armor  or no armor. A helpless Specialist does not gain the benefit of evasion.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Quarry </b>
		<br> At 11th level, a Specialist can, as an action, denote one target within her line of sight as her quarry. Whenever she is following the tracks of her quarry, a Specialist can take 10 on her Survival skill checks while moving at normal speed, without penalty. In addition, she receives a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls made against her quarry, and her quarry’s Crit Guard is considered to be 8 lower than normal. A Specialist can have no more than one quarry at a time and the creature’s type must correspond to one of her favored enemy types. She can dismiss this effect at any time as a free action, but she cannot select a new quarry for 24 hours. If the Specialist sees proof that her quarry is dead, she can select a new quarry after waiting 1 hour.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Camouflage </b>
		<br> A Specialist of 12th level or higher can use the Stealth skill to hide in any of her favored terrains, even if the terrain doesn’t grant cover or concealment.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Improved Evasion </b>
		<br> At 16th level, a Specialist’s evasion improves. This ability works like evasion, except that while the Specialist still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless Specialist does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Improved Quarry </b>
		<br> At 19th level, the Specialist’s ability to hunt her quarry improves. She can now select a quarry as a free action, and can now take 20 while using Survival to track her quarry, while moving at normal speed without penalty. Her insight bonus to attack her quarry increases to +4. If her quarry is killed or dismissed, she can select a new one after 10 minutes have passed.
