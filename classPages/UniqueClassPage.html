	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Unique Classes </b>
		<br> These are the house specials, these classes were created specifically for TWE. These classes tend to be more specifically related to TWE than the others, and as such may be tied to the lore of the world. In these cases, choosing a class may restrict where your character can be from.
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="classes/SpecialistPage.html">Specialist</a> </b>
		<br> A true survivalist who eschews magic for the skills she has learned with her own two hands. There are several different paths for Specialists to follow, but that is a decision for them to make after they have gained some substantial experience. Whether they are beastmasters, trappers, herbalists, or tacticians, specialists are the highly trained operatives that focus on getting the job done.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="classes/RuneKnight.html">Rune Knight</a> </b>
		<br> Hailing from Enthan, the Rune Knights are the epitome of those who seek to protect the average citizen. In Enthan, arcane magic is looked upon with suspicion. The common people do not understand it, but it has the capacity to harm and enslave many. In order to combat its pervasive power, the Rune Knights arose. These veteran warriors are heavy armored juggernauts who spent enough time studying magic to know how it works- and more importantly, how to kill it. 

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="classes/ManaBoundPage.html">ManaBound</a> </b>
		<br> Among the Tri-Villages of Taria there sits a town known as Werta. Here, the most focused martial artists practice a special kind of elemental mastery in the form of Mana. With the cionstantly renewing power of Mana on their side, the combative ManaBound cut all connnection to other magics in exchange for a regenerating supply of power that lets them fling elemental destruction right along with their carefully trained unarmed blows.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="classes/WildDancerPage.html">Wild Dancer</a> </b>
		<br> All around TWE, people have learned to meld their cultural arts with the deadly and alluring dance of nature, harnessing its power through grace, its magic through unity, and are stepping into battle with their bestial dance partners.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="classes/ArcaneWellspringPage.html">Arcane Wellspring</a> </b>
		<br> Casting aside the time-sensitive battle-casting mindset of their posh past, the Arcane Wellspring arose as a class of wizards who twist spell into ritual. These beacons of hope spread their magic over their allies like a safety blanket, ensuring that as long as they still stand, their communities will not fall to outsiders.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="classes/FluxcasterPage.html">Fluxcaster</a> </b>
		<br> Far in the east, where magic has taken a whole new meaning, there exists a new breed of magician who redefines the term “caster.” These people are weak in body but strong in spirit. They carry within themselves reservoirs of this strange foreign power called flux. Fluxcasters eschew physical fitness and fortitude, tying their minds and spirits to flux in order to wield its power by calling forth flux into the physical world. Every fluxcaster is unique, wielding the diverse power of flux as a reflection of their own minds and personalities.
