	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Core Classes </b>
	<br> These are called the core classes because they represent the core ideas found at the center of all classes. These classes are purists, focusing on what makes them special without bridging into each other's territory. We have pure arcane casters, cunning pickpockets, mighty warriors, devout priests, experienced survivalists, discplined martial artists, skilled entertainers, and forces of nature. 
	<br><br> These classes are excellent for new players and veterans alike, offering pure and simple character archetypes that are easy to understand but compelling enough to stand the test of time.
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter">Fighter</a> </b>
		<br> This is your man-at-arms, a master of every weapon and suit of armor imaginable. These warriors are the most reliable out there, blending a wealth of martial experience with the bravery to look a dragon in the face, brandish a sharpened stick, and get to work.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian">Barbarian</a> </b>
		<br> Barbarians are the most simplistic and terrifying warriors to step onto the battlefield. They are the toughest around, able to take the most punishment before giving in. They are unmatched in raw strength, and possess the ability to enter a battle frenzy that makes them even stronger and tougher. They know only one thing: They have a weapon, and they are going to smash you with it.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk">Monk</a> </b>
		<br> Monks are the masters of unarmed combat, developing their bodies into the ultimate weapons. They attack faster than any other class, with rapid series of jabs and kicks and headbutts that keep their opponents guessing. With the addition of their spiritual Ki energy giving them supernatural powers, they are a versatile warrior who can adapt to any situation.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin">Paladin</a> </b>
		<br> These are the holy warriors and paragons of virtue. These white knights are heavily armored protectors of the weak, trained in strong sword and stout shield. They dabble in divine magics, just enough godly favor to help them heal their allies and smite the evil of the world. 

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">Cleric</a></b>
		<br> Clerics are the followers of the gods. They receive power from on high, using it to bring comfort and relief to their allies in the form of protection and succor. Their enemies, however, are faced with the divine wrath of their god and the terror of their expertly wielded sacred weapons.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">Bard</a> </b>
		<br> The Bard is an entertainer at heart, a role with a wide range of applications. At the core of it all, they are traveling with their instrument in hand to bring support to their allies and a sense of adventure that no other class can hope to match. Whether it be the swashbuckling pirate with a heart singing voice, the dainty harpist smoothly sidestepping her enemies to the tune of her strings, or an eager violinist just looking forward to what the next road will bring him, the bard is sure to bring a sense of style to their battles.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">Rogue</a> </b>
		<br> Thieves, scoundrels, tricksters, and charlatans. These are the traditional labels attached to those who creep in the shadows. The rogue can be all of these and more. An assassin, a benevolent swindler, a pickpocket, or a grifter, the rogue has many forms but they all move with a level of cunning and precision unmatched by any other class.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger">Ranger</a> </b>
		<br> Practiced survivalists, hunters, and friends of the natural world. The Rangers are often archers, but can train in a different style if they wish. What makes a ranger is their connection to nature, which might take the form of a loyal animal companion, and their reliance on a mixture of experience and instinct to help them defeat their enemies.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">Druid</a> </b>
		<br> The Druids act as the arm of nature itself. Accompanied by an animal companion and the ability to turn into any animal they desire, the druid would be dangerous enough without the ability to cast nature spells. Druids can fight, heal, summon the forces of nature, transform their bodies, and generally handle any situation put in front of them.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer">Sorcerer</a> </b>
		<br> Some among us are born with the power of magc flowing through their veins. For sorcerers, this is very literal. Sorcerers harness the power of ancestral magic, wielding their bloodlines to cast spells with unparalleled power and versatility. Their bodies may be frail, but anyone foolish enough to challenge them will be hard pressed to kill them before being overtaken by their sheer magical might.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">Wizard</a> </b>
		<br> Wizard is a title that is thrown around too loosely. To the layman, a wizard is a spellcaster, but the term means so much more. Wizards have dedicated their lives to studying and uncovering the secrets of arcane magic, and as such are unparalleled in their understanding. They carry a compendium of magic in their tomes and wield a breadth of magical spells that no other caster can hope to contest. They must take more care in preparing their spells than others do, but they are no strangers to thinking things through.
