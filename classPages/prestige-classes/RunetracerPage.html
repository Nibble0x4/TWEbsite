	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> The Runetracer </b>
	<br> All around TWE, people go about their lives. History is made, recorded, learned, and the ones who come after pass on the knowledge that came before. Thus, nothing is lost...
	<br>But that isn't how it really goes. The people of TWE live their lives on ground that once belonged to others, ones who came long before, and they do so ignorantly. Keen-eyed adventurers will notice remnants of a civilization that came long before them, bits and pieces scattered throughout the world of TWE. These pieces are few, mysterious, and often frustratingly incomplete.
	<br>Among these ancient remnants, particularly keen observers with an interest in the arcane will notice strange symbols that appear in ancient ruins, on miraculously preserved artifacts, and even written in the stone that eventually grew up to cover whoever came before.
	<br>These symbols have come to be known as Runes, glyphs that seem to contain power imbued into them long, long ago. Their meanings are not fully understood, but there are some among the arcane scholars of the world that have dedicated themselves to the task of uncovering, recording, classifying, and replicating these Runes.
	<br>Scholars like these are known simply as Runetracers, wielders of magic from another time and another civilization. Their power is raw, albeit indirect, and clearly a predecessor to the modern understanding of magic. They are not bound by spells or slots, instead drawing and empowering runes at their discretion to achieve effects suited to their situation.

	<br><br><b>Role</b>: As a Prestige Class, Runetracers are always adventurers with some measure of experience prior to their study of the Runes.
	<br>Because of this, they can theoretically fit any role. However, there are some types of adventurers that may find the life of a runetracer more appealing:
	<br>A wizard, naturally, has the education and life of arcane study to make him perfectly suited to this role. His spells will be empowered by his runes, and he can use them when his more powerful spells have run dry.
	<br>A witch thrives on strange, esoteric magic. Adding runes to her arsenal will grant her ways of elevating her spellcasting and give her more tricks to confound her victims.
	<br>A magus will thrive, easily blending her martial skill and arcane power with the versatile options presented by runes.
Other adventurers may struggle to meet the requirements of a runetracer, but there is significant value for them if they manage to do so.
	<br>A sorcerer, while not typically inclined to using study to master his magic, can still find a resource in runes that can further empower him and grant him more options to his limited spell repertoir.
	<br>A bard can excel as a runetracer, using the runes to amplify her performance and her control over the battlefield.
	<br>Druids, clerics, students of magic that isn't arcane in nature, may struggle to learn the basics of the arcane. However, if they do, they will find unique ways that runes can synergize with their own powers.
	<br>Finally, even fighters, barbarians, and rogues can dabble in runic study. They may not be used to casting spells, but they will read the runes in ways that even the most experienced wizard cannot.

	<br> 
	<br><br> 

		<hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader">Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>
		<br> A runetracer gains no proficiencies in any weapons or armors.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Runetracing"> Runetracing </b>
		<br> The Runetracer's hallmark skill is the ability to draw arcane symbols of power. They inscribe these runes and imbue them with their own energy, allowing them to persist for potentially unending periods.
		<br><br> <b>At first level</b>, the runetracer selects <b>two runes</b> from the <a href="runetracerSubpages/rune-list.html">Rune Archives</a> as ones that she knows. She can learn new runes by <b>finding them in the world</b> of TWE or by <b>levelling up</b> as a runetracer.
		<br> <b>At every new runetracer level, she learns 1 new rune</b>.
		<br>
		<br> Tracing a rune normally takes 2 actions and requires the Runetracer to use some sort of drawing implement.
		<br> In order to trace a rune, a medium must be selected. There are 5 total mediums, though not every rune is suited to every medium.
		<ol>
				<li><b><u>Air</u></b> - This medium requires nothing more than the finger of the tracer and is very quick. Tracing a rune this way takes only 1 action and may not cost any RE. Runes traced in this way dissipate immediately after being used. If their effects last more than one turn, then the rune appears on the surface of whatever was created as a result of the rune.</li>
				<li><b><u>Surface</u></b> - Any solid surface capable of bearing writing (the ground, sand, glass, a wall, etc) can bear a rune. Runes traced on a surface are not singular runes only. Instead, 2d6 are rolled when the runetracer begins to trace a Surface rune. They spend the RE cost when they trace the first rune, but can then inscribe a number of surface runes up to the rolled result without spending any additional RE. All runes must be within 20 feet of at least one other rune. The area included within these runes is used to create the effect the moment all the runes are complete. </li>
				<li><b><u>Weapon</u></b> - Runes can be traced on a weapon, infusing it with power. Most weapons cannot handle more than one rune on them without becoming unstable. </li>
				<li><b><u>Apparel</u></b> - Runes can be traced on clothing, armor, and accessories. Anything worn could potentially receive a rune if it is large enough.</li>
				<li><b><u>Item</u></b> - Any item that is not included in the above categories counts as an Item and can be infused with a rune as well.</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="body-text"><br> A rune inscribed on a surface, weapon, apparel, or item can be <b>destroyed</b> by dealing physical damage to it. A rune has a number of <b>HP equal to twice the creator's Runetracer level</b>.
		<br> In addition, a rune can be <b>disenchanted</b> by a dispel magic spell or by being magically erased. Doing so requires a <b>caster level check</b> opposed to a <b>DC of 10 + Twice the Runetracer's Runetracer level + the Runetracer's Int + the RE invested in the rune</b>.
		<br> If a rune calls for a <b>save</b>, the <b>DC</b> is equal to <b>10 + the RE stored in the rune + the runetracer's Int modifier</b>.
		<br> Some runes have features that may modify this, granting extra ways to be disenchanted or making them more resilient in some way.
	</p>

		<br><br>
		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Runic-Energy"> Runic Energy </b>
		<br> The Runetracer gains a pool of energy equal to <b>twice her Runetracer level plus her intelligence modifier (min 1)</b>.
		<br> This energy is spent in order to empower and sustain Runes. These points are allotted to a rune when the rune is traced and can be recalled as a swift action, leaving the rune inert.
		<br> Runic Energy (RE) remains in a rune until it is recalled or the rune is destroyed or disenchanted by another. If the tracer is knocked unconscious or even killed, the RE remains in the rune until one of these things occur.

		<br> For the most part, any points spent from this pool are returned upon the destruction or disenchantment of one of the runetracer's runes. However, there are some effects that call for the runetracer to 'Burn' her RE.
		<br> Each day, when she is preparing her spells, the runetracer can <b>regain a number of burnt RE equal to her Runetracer level</b>.

		

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Shorthand"> Shorthand </b>
		<br> At 2nd level and every two levels thereafter, the Runetracer learns a shorthand trick that helps her to do her work more efficiently. Choose one from the list of <a href="">Runetracer Shorthands</a>.
		<br> temp list blehp: Runic Energy Expansion - Gain 2 more RE.
Reflexive Trace - Can spend an attack of opportunity to Air trace a 0 RE rune as an immediate action when that rune may be needed. I.E. An attack or save or something.
Uncapped Spellruning - When you use Spellruning to increase the Caster Level of the spell, remove any phrases in the spell that put a limit on how high the Caster Level can go.
Combat Tracer - Do not provoke AoO when you trace.
		

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Spellruning"> Spellruning </b>
		<br> At 3rd level, the runetracer learns to use her runes to enhance her other spellcasting.
		<br> As an <b>immediate action when the runetracer casts a spell</b>, she may trace a singular rune as part of the somatic components of the spell. If the spell does not have somatic components, one is added.
		<br> Doing this is called <b>'runing a spell.'</b> Runing a spell can only be done with a rune that matches the spell type or subtype in some way (Example: An Ash rune could be used to rune a 'Burning Hands' spell, but not a 'Feather Fall' spell.)
		<br> Runing a spell requires the runetracer to <b>Burn 1 RE</b> from her pool.
		<br><br> When a spell has been successfully Runed, choose one of the following bonuses:
		<ol>
			<li>Increase the <b>Caster Level</b> of the spell by 1. </li>
			<li>Increase the <b>DC</b> of the spell by 1. </li>
			<li>Increase the <b>number of possible targets</b> by 1. </li>
		</ol>

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Runic-Research"> Runic Research </b>
		<br> At 5th level, the runetracer has become so skilled at tracing that she is ready to try her hand at discovery. During downtime, she can roll <b>Spellcraft</b> to make progress on researching a new rune.
		<br> Once her research has attained a total of <b>200</b>, she may work with the DM to discover a brand new rune not yet included in the Rune Archive. She can choose whether to share her research, adding the new rune to the Archive, or not. If her research is stolen, she retains knowledge of the rune but it will not be exclusive to her anymore.

		<br><br> For every successful rune she discovers, the total she must attain to discover a new rune <b>increases by 100</b>.

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Spelltracing"> Spelltracing </b>
		<br> At 7th level, the runetracer has become adept at capturing the essence of magic in runic form. Whenever she observes a spell being cast, she may make a <b>spellcraft check</b> with a <b>DC equal to 10 + the caster level of the caster + the level of the spell</b>.
		<br> If she succeeds, she has an idea of how to trace the spell. She can then choose to spend 1 full-round action and <b>burn RE equal to twice the level of the spell</b> in order to trace a rune containing the essence of the spell upon a surface. If she does not do this within <b>1d4 rounds</b>, she loses her idea.

		<br><br> The rune containing the essence of the spell is volatile, and will react unpredictably if destroyed. The rune can be activated as an action, releasing the spell. If the rune still contains the spell, it can be studied and the spell within learned as if it were written in a wizard's spellbook.
