	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> The Barrier Rune </b>
	<br> 

	<br><br><b>Description</b>: The Barrier rune glows softly, without pulse or fluctuation in its light. It radiates strength, simulaneously daring you to try to approach it and warning you to stay away.

	<br><br><b>Summary</b>: Barrier is all about protection and durability, reinforcing armor, keeping objects safe from harm, and constructing barriers to isolate areas.

		<br><br> <b> [0]  <u>Air:</u></b>  Air - Creates a barrier around the user that reduces the next source of damage by an amount equal to twice the tracer's Runetracer level. Holding this requires the dedicated use of one hand and concentration. When damage is taken, the rune can be held if concentration is made against the damage taken.

		<p class="body-text"><br><br> <b> [1]  <u>Item:</u></b>   Surrounds the item in a thin barrier, keeping its surface from being touched by anything that doesn't deal direct damage. The item can still be moved by touching its barrier.

		<p class="body-text"><br><br> <b> [3]  <u>Weapon:</u></b>   Hardens the weapon, doubling its Hardness and HP. 
		<ul>

		</ul>

		<p class="body-text"><br><br> <b> [2]  <u>Surface:</u></b>   A barrier of force is erected along the borders of the runes. It extends upward from the runes 10 feet and then forms a box or dome, based on the user's choice. This barrier stops the passage of anything into or out of the area until the runes are destroyed or until the barrier's HP is reduced to 0.
		<br>	The barrier has a Hardness equal to twice the tracer's Runetracer level. It's max HP is equal to 20 * the amount of RE you put into it.
		<ul>
			<li><b>[4]</b> - Visibility through the barrier is reduced as if the light level was two levels lower (to a minimum of darkness)</li>
			<li><b>[6]</b> - Making contact with the barrier deals (RE/2)d4 points of force damage.</li>
			<li><b>[8]</b> - Double the HP of the surface runes holding the barrier. It gains RE hardness.</li>
			<li><b>[9]</b> - The barrier regains 2RE HP every turn at the beginning of your turn.</li>
		</ul>
