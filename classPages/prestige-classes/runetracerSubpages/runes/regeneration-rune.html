	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> The Regeneration Rune </b>
	<br> 

	<br><br><b>Description</b>: The Regeneration rune glows with a soft green light. Gazing upon it makes your skin tingle, reminding you of the pain you recently felt.

	<br><br><b>Summary</b>: Regeneration is a source of healing and succor, amplifying other healing sources. Using it to heal on its own burns RE quickly, but it can also restore objects to their rightful state.

	<hr>

		<br><br><p class="body-text"><b class="classFeatureSubheader"> Compatible Mediums</b>

		<br><br> <b> [0]  <u>Air:</u></b>  Air - The tracer removes one of the following status effects from themselves or 1 creature they can touch:
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li><b></b> - Dazzled, Dazed, Fascinated, Confused, Antagonized, Sickened 1, Bleed, Shaken 1, Asleep, or Dying.</li>
			<li><b>[2]</b> - The tracer can burn RE to remove one of the following status effects, IF they are not permanent:</li>
			<ul>
			<li><b></b> - Deafened, Blinded, Stunned, Slowed, Staggered, Nauseated, Fatigued, Exhausted (becomes fatigued), Petrified, Unconscious, or Disabled.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<p class="body-text"><br><br> <b> [4]  <u>Item:</u></b>   Whenever the item is destroyed, broken, or damaged, it regenerates 1 round later. If the object was completely destroyed (like by exploding), the rune is destroyed as well.

		<p class="body-text"><br><br> <b> [1]  <u>Weapon:</u></b>   The weapon heals itself to full at the start of the tracer's turn. If the weapon gains the broken condition, it loses that condition as well.

		<p class="body-text"><br><br> <b> [4]  <u>Apparel:</u></b>   The apparel never seems to change, remaining the same level of dirty or worn out that it was when the rune was placed. The effects differ according to the slot the apparel fits:
		<ul>
			<li><b>All Slots</b> - If the apparel is damaged or broken, it is regenerated at the start of the wearer's turn.</li>
			<li><b>Neck</b> - The wearer cannot be the victim of death effects, negative levels, or some curses such as lycanthropy, vampirism, or undeath.</li>
			<li><b>Waist, Shoulders, Arms</b> - While wearing this apparel, the wearer's ability scores cannot be lowered and any damage to them is removed. If the apparel is removed, the damage returns.</li>
			<li><b>Feet</b> -  Damaged structures or surfaces are restored to their original state when the wearer walks over them, if they wish. They remain this way only so long as their foot remains on them.</li>
			<li><b>Hands</b> - Any healing granted by the hand wearing this apparel grants an additional amount of HP equal to the RE cost of the rune.</li>
			<li><b>Head, Torso, legs</b> - When the wearer is healed, increase the HP regained by the RE cost of the rune.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="body-text"><br><br> <b> [1+]  <u>Surface:</u></b>   The area enclosed by these runes becomes a Healing Runic Circle. Any creatures or objects in the circle gain Fast Healing 1. At the start of the tracer's next turn, reduce the healing amount by 1 and burn 1 RE from the cost. When the cost reaches 0, the runes become inert.
		<br>If the runes are disenchanted by their tracer, she burns the remaining RE instead of returning it to her pool.
		<br>(Example: If she traces this rune with 6 RE stored in it, all creatures inside will gain Fast Healing 6 for 1 round and the tracer will burn 1 RE. Next round, Fast Healing 5 and burn another. If all creatures remain in the circle until the runes become inert, they will heal a total of 21 HP and the tracer will have burned 6 RE.)

		<br><br><p class="body-text"><b class="classFeatureSubheader"> Acceptable Usage</b>

			<br><br> <b><u>Noun:</u></b>  This rune can be used as a Noun, allowing it to function in the ways listed above. It can also be modified by other runes that are used as Adjectives.

			<br><br> <b><u>Adjectives:</u></b>  This rune can be used as an Adjective, allowing it to modify other runes used as a Noun.
			<br> If used as an Adjective, the modified rune experiences the following changes:
			<ul>
				<li> The modified rune regenerates after being destroyed. After regenerating, the Regeneration Adjective is lost.  </li>
			</ul>

	<hr>

		<br><br><p class="body-text"><b class="classFeatureSubheader"> Additional Breaking Rules</b>

			<br><br> <b><u>Strength:</u></b>  This rune and any rune modified by it regenerates immediately upon being destroyed. When the Singular rune is regenerated, flip a coin. If it is heads, the rune can regenerate again.
			<br><br> <b><u>Weakness:</u></b>  This rune and any rune modified by it is weak to negative energy damage and can be dispelled by death effects. If it is destroyed or dispelled in this way, it does not regenerate.
