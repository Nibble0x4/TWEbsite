	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> The Lock Rune </b>
	<br> 

	<br><br><b>Description</b>: The Lock rune pulses when you look at it, as if taunting you. Gazing at it makes you instinctively shift uncomfortably, as if your skin is wet cement that might dry if you remain still.

	<br><br><b>Summary</b>: Lock excels at holding things as they are. It can keep people in place, deny passage, and keep unwanted intruders out.

	<hr>

		<br><br><p class="body-text"><b class="classFeatureSubheader"> Compatible Mediums</b>

		<br><br> <b> [0]  <u>Air:</u></b>  Air - A single target within 30 feet of the tracer must make a save of their choice or else be locked in place, regardless of their current position. They can attempt the save again as an action on their turn, but can only try this once per turn. This effect keeps them from moving out of their space, but does not otherwise inhibit actions. If the target is aloft, they do not fall while under the effects of this rune. 
		<br> This effect remains on a target for only 1 turn, unless the tracer dedicates a hand and concentration to sustaining it.

		<p class="body-text"><br><br> <b> [4]  <u>Item:</u></b>   If the item can open (such as a door or box), it is now locked and cannot be opened without a spell (the caster must succeed on a Caster Level Check against the rune) or a Disable Device check made by someone who can cast spells.
		<br>If the item cannot open (such as a stone or a weapon), it is locked in place and cannot be moved without a Strength check made against the rune as if it were a Caster Level Check.

		<p class="body-text"><br><br> <b> [1]  <u>Weapon:</u></b>  The weapon locks into the grip of the first person to wield it and cannot be dropped or removed from the wielder's hand intentionally or unintentionally.
		<br> Turns any metal weapon into a Masterwork Cold Lock weapon. If more RE is spent, the weapon gains Runic Enhancement bonuses that can stack with existing Enhancement bonuses.
		<ul>
			<li><b>[2]</b> - +1</li>
			<li><b>[4]</b> - +2</li>
			<li><b>[7]</b> - +3</li>
			<li><b>[10]</b> - +4</li>
			<li><b>[14]</b> - +5</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="body-text"><br><br> <b> [1]  <u>Apparel:</u></b>   The apparel no longer flows as smoothly, not tossed or ruffled by the wind.
		<ul>
			<li><b>All Slots</b> - The apparel is locked in place on the wearer's body as per the Item Medium for an item that both can and cannot open.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="body-text"><br><br> <b> [8]  <u>Surface:</u></b>   The area enclosed by these runes is closed off, creating a wall of shimmering force that rises 10 feet into the air and forms a dome over the area.
		<br>Creatures cannot enter or exit the area, though objects and spells can pass through freely.

			<br><br> <b><u>Adjectives:</u></b>  This rune can be used as an Adjective, allowing it to modify other runes used as a Noun.
			<br> If used as an Adjective, the modified rune experiences the following changes:
			<ul>
				<li> Any constructs made by the modified rune are ocked in place as per the Item Medium for an item that cannot open.</li>

	<hr>

		<br><br><p class="body-text"><b class="classFeatureSubheader"> Additional Breaking Rules</b>
