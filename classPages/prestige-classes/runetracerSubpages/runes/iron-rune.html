	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> The Iron Rune </b>
	<br> 

	<br><br><b>Description</b>: The Iron rune hardly seems to glow at all, but the feeling you get when you look at it too closely assures you of its power. Your muscles tighten and you feel unbreakable.

	<br><br><b>Summary</b>: Iron transmutes some objects into metal, strengthening and refining anything already made of the stuff.

	<hr>

		<br><br><p class="body-text"><b class="classFeatureSubheader"> Compatible Mediums</b>

		<br><br> <b> [0]  <u>Air:</u></b>  Air - Can be used to form a Cold Iron weapon patterned after one that the user is proficient with. The weapon is treated as a -1 enhancement bonus version of that weapon and lasts for as long as the rune is held. Doing so requires one dedicated hand and concentration. RE can be spent to increase the enhancement bonus of the weapon.
		<ul>
			<li><b>[3]</b> - +1</li>
			<li><b>[5]</b> - +2</li>
			<li><b>[8]</b> - +3</li>
			<li><b>[12]</b> - +4</li>
			<li><b>[16]</b> - +5</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="body-text"><br><br> <b> [2]  <u>Item:</u></b>   The item is now made of Cold Iron. When the rune is destroyed, it will revert to its original makeup.
		<br> More RE can be spent to increase the damage dealt by the item's scream.

		<p class="body-text"><br><br> <b> [3]  <u>Weapon:</u></b>   Turns any non-metal weapon into metal, increasing its str requirement by 2 (if it has one) or giving it a str requirement of 11 (if it doesn't). This increases the damage dice size by 1 step.
		<br> Turns any metal weapon into a Masterwork Cold Iron weapon. If more RE is spent, the weapon gains Runic Enhancement bonuses that can stack with existing Enhancement bonuses.
		<ul>
			<li><b>[2]</b> - +1</li>
			<li><b>[4]</b> - +2</li>
			<li><b>[7]</b> - +3</li>
			<li><b>[10]</b> - +4</li>
			<li><b>[14]</b> - +5</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="body-text"><br><br> <b> [3]  <u>Apparel:</u></b>   The apparel becomes heavier, more rigid, made of metal. The effects differ according to the slot the apparel fits:
		<ul>
			<li><b>All Slots</b> - If the apparel is not metal, it becomes metal. It gains the Lightning Rod tag and grants DR/- equal to the RE of this rune. If the apparel is metal, it becomes Cold Iron. It gains +1 AC, DR/- equal to the RE of this rune, and can apply its full DR as a bonus on saves against Fae effects.</li>
			<li><b>Feet</b> - The wearer can generate small Cold Iron spikes from their feet. These add 1d3 damage to unarmed kick attacks, but otherwise can be used like stakes. The wearer can choose to release these spikes and leave them somewhere, but can only sustain up to 3 at a time.</li>
			<li><b>Hands</b> - The wearer can generate small Cold Iron spikes in their hands. These add 1d3 damage to unarmed punch attacks, but otherwise can be used like stakes. The wearer can choose to release these spikes and leave them somewhere, but can only sustain up to 3 at a time.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="body-text"><br><br> <b> [2]  <u>Surface:</u></b>   The area enclosed by these runes becomes a Cold Iron surface with Hardness equal to its RE cost. Barefoot creatures standing on this surface take 4d4 cold damage each turn. All creatures standing on the surface gain the Lightning Rod tag.

		<br><br><p class="body-text"><b class="classFeatureSubheader"> Acceptable Usage</b>

			<br><br> <b><u>Noun:</u></b>  This rune can be used as a Noun, allowing it to function in the ways listed above. It can also be modified by other runes that are used as Adjectives.

			<br><br> <b><u>Adjectives:</u></b>  This rune can be used as an Adjective, allowing it to modify other runes used as a Noun.
			<br> If used as an Adjective, the modified rune experiences the following changes:
			<ul>
				<li> The modified rune itself is weak to acid damage and gains Hardness equal to its RE cost.</li>
				<li> Any constructs made by the modified rune are made of Cold Iron and has the same Hardness as the rune itself, but is weak to acid damage.  </li>
			</ul>

	<hr>

		<br><br><p class="body-text"><b class="classFeatureSubheader"> Additional Breaking Rules</b>
