	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> The Toxotai </b>
	<br> In the eastern plains of Taria stands the legendary Tri-Villages, three villages that have spent generations raising master warriors specializing in different kinds of warfare.
	<br> From the westernmost Tri-Village, Carta, come the Toxotai. These master marksmen have dedicated their lives to chasing the mastery attained by their great founder, Cartra.
	<br> Cartra was a master of positioning, always in the right place at the right time. It is said she could see the future, but her people know otherwise. They seek to mimic her skills through the careful study of distance.
	<br> Sponsored and guided by the goddess Artemis, the Toxotai train to attain a fraction of Cartra's skills.
	<br> Before they can be trained, toxotai must prove themselves. They often are trained as fighters, rangers, rogues, or even inquisitors and clerics before coming to receive the title of Toxotus.

	<br><br><b>Role</b>: As a Prestige Class, Toxotai are always adventurers with some measure of experience prior to their training in Carta.
	<br>Because of this, they can have a variety of backgrounds. However, they are typically best if they are wisd with a strong dexterity and extensive experience with a ranged weapon.
	<br>Rangers are the most common and natural fit, due to their affinity for bowmanship and their wisdom connection to nature.
	<br>Fighters make solid Toxotai due to their mastery of weapon groups.
	<br>Inquisitors and clerics, especially those that follow Artemis herself, often fit in extremely well as toxotai.
	<br>Rogues often learn shortbows and are already used to considering positioning with their sneak attacks.
	<br>Finally, the door to Toxotus training swings open to anyone willing to put in the effort. It is uncommon for other classes, perhaps, but not unheard of!

		<br> Toxotai are exclusive in their use of bows. None of her toxotus abilities can be used unless she is wielding a bow of some kind.
		<br>However, they are also capable of handling any bow. They gain proficiency with any bow they find, though they can still take penalties if they fail to meet the requirements for wielding it.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Positioning"> Positioning </b>
		<br> Toxotai are trained to adapt to an ever-shifting battlefield, always working to put themselves in the perfect place to land the perfect shot.
		<br> Toxotai learn how to leverage several different positions in combat, but they inevitably get better taking advantage of some positions than others.
		<br><br> At 1st level, a toxotus chooses three of the Positions and gains rank 1 in them.
		<br> At each level afterward, she chooses two Positions and increases her rank in it by 1, or gains rank 1 in a Position she does not already have.
		<br><br> When making an attack action, the toxotus may choose to employ 1 of the positions she has at least 1 rank in, as long as the conditions for using that position are satisfied.
		<br>Below is the list of Positions that Toxotai are trained to use.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Fletching"> Fletching </b>
		<br>During downtime, Toxotai often busy themselves fletching more arrows to fill their quivers.
		<br>Toxotai can manage up to two different quivers during combat, each holding no more than 20 arrows. Because of this, they are careful about what kinds of arrows they bring.

		<br><br>Toxotai can fletch during an hour of downtime. They can spend a maximum of four hours fletching each day before losing focus.
		<br>In each hour, the Toxotai decide what arrows they want to craft and roll a craft check. They can add this to a running total and complete their task when they have the appropriate result.
