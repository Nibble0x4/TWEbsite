	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> The Spirit Trainer </b>
	<br> In the world of adventuring, being a genuine and kind person is rarely a boon. Even for paladins and clerics, being considerate and kind is not exactly a source of power. 
	<br> However, the recent release of powerful, volatile, sentient, immortal spirits of nature has changed this. These spirits have been known to accompany travelers who catch their attention, working with them for as long as they feel so inclined. 
	<br> With the advent of these spirits, a new breed of adventurer has appeared. Spirit Trainers, people who lack special powers beyond their ability to relate to others, have found a source of power.

	<br><br><b>Role</b>: As a Prestige Class, Spirit Trainers can come from all walks of life. There is truly no restriction on class. The only real requirement for a Spirit Trainer is to be skilled at working with others. As a result, charismatic classes like Bards, Clerics, Sorcerers, and Paladins are natural fits to train Spirits.
	<br> However, the Spirits care little for what class or history an adventurer may have. The biggest test is whether the adventurer can find and befriend a Spirit in the first place. That is the first and greatest hurdle to becoming a trainer.

		<hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader">Weapon and Armor Proficiency </b>
		<br> A Spirit Trainer gains no new weapon, armor, or shield proficiencies.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Spirit-Partners"> Spirit Partners </b>
		<br> The Spirit Trainer can form bonds with Spirits. For more information on the different Spirits found in TWE, use <a href="spiritTrainerSubpages/SpiritList.html">the Spirit List</a>.
		<br><br> This ability is not unique to Spirit Trainers, but they can take it to new heights. Here is a basic summary of how spirit partners work.
		<br><br> Each spirit has 4 “moves.” These moves are performed when the spirit’s partner requests assistance from them. These moves all relate to the central element of the spirit (Example: Ignis the Fire Spirit’s moves all utilize fire), and they have specific purposes.
		<br> Each turn, once per turn, a spirit’s partner can spend an action to request assistance from their partnered spirit. They ask for a specific move and give instruction as to how they want it to be performed. In the absence of such instruction, the spirit will either do nothing or perform the indicated move as they feel so inclined.
		<br> As a part of their turn, the spirit can move to any place within 20 feet of their partner before performing a Move. Performing a Move ends their action. <b>They cannot exist more than 20 feet from their partners.</b>
		<br><br> Spirits are immortal, but they can be defeated. When a spirit is defeated or in some way interfered with to such a degree that they can no longer keep themselves together, they dissipate. 		
		<br> The most common way for a spirit to be dissipated is to be damaged too much, though there are other ways such as burnout, elemental canceling, and the defeat of their mortal partner. When a spirit is dissipated, they are no longer considered partnered to their mortal. The bond is broken.
		<br> For an immortal creature, “HP” is a meaningless term. However, we may refer to the strength of the bond between the spirit and its trainer as HP when considering things such as damage. Unlike other mortals, Spirit Trainers are capable of viewing the strength of spirit bonds. 
		<br> The strength of the bond between a Spirit Trainer and his spirits has HP equal to <b>[10 + 6 * his Spirit Trainer level + 2 * his other class levels]</b>.
		<br> At the start of each day, or at the end, depending on the spirit, the spirit restores a bit of its bond’s strength. For normal mortals, the bond regains 1 HP per their mortal’s level. <b>A Spirit Trainer’s spirits gain 2 HP per Spirit Trainer level, and 1 HP per other level</b>.
		<br><br> Any mortal has the potential to form a bond with a spirit. However, mortals can only handle being bonded to a single spirit at a time. Anything more would destroy them.
		<br> When a bond occurs, the spirit may move between two states:
		<ol>
			<li> Active: In this state, the spirit is physically manifested in the visible world. They can be seen, touched, heard, and otherwise interacted with by all nearby. </li>
			<li> Passive: In this state, the spirit disappears into the shadow of their partnered mortal. They can still barely be detected, as they cause the shadow of their mortal to shift in such a manner as to reflect what spirit is within (Example: Ignis the Fire Spirit might cause the shadow to flicker like flame). The spirit may still speak, but their words are quiet. </li>
		</ol>



		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Positioning"> Starter </b>
		<br> A Spirit Trainer, at 1st level, makes a special bond with the spirit in his shadow, making them his starter spirit. His bonded spirit makes a particularly strong bond with him. This spirit’s bond to the Trainer is more resilient, allowing the Trainer to call his starter spirit back to him even if they are defeated and dissipate during battle.
		<br> When a Starter Spirit is using their moves, the Spirit Trainer level of their partnered mortal is considered to be 1 higher than normal.
		<br> When his starter spirit is dissipated, the Trainer manages to collect a core piece of their existence. This piece can be used to reform the spirit in a ritual that takes an hour to complete. When a starter spirit is reformed, they are weak and vulnerable.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Positioning"> Spiritrips </b>
		<br> At 1st level, the Spirit Trainer learns some basic tricks called spiritrips that he can perform by tapping into the nature of his spirits. These are simple tricks that he can perform whenever he wishes. They require an action to perform. Here they are:
		<ol>
			<li> Hide Shadow: The Spirit Trainer’s shadow is calmed so that it no longer looks like you have a passive spirit in it. This lasts until you choose to end it or until the spirit becomes active. Hiding your shadow takes effort on the part of your spirits, and they don't enjoy it. </li>
			<li> Spirit Sleep: The Spirit Trainer can put one of his spirits to sleep, sending them to his shadow and essentially muting their existence such that, for all intents and purposes, they are not present. Spirits do not like to exist in this state, and may resist. If they resist, you must <b>roll a d20 + your Spirit Trainer level + your charisma modifier</b> to try to force them. If you succeed, they are forced into sleep. <b>If you fail, they cannot be unwillingly targeted by this spiritrip for the rest of the day</b>. </li>
			<li> Spirit Switch: The Spirit Trainer changes the state of two spirits, shifting them from passive to active or active to passive. If the spirits do not want to switch, then you may attempt to force them similarly to the Spirit Sleep spiritrip. <b>If a spirit resists Spirit Switch, they cannot be targeted by it again for 3 rounds. A spirit cannot perform a move in the same turn after they have been affected by Spirit Switch</b>. </li>
		</ol>
 
 		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Spirit-Action"> Spirit Action </b>
		<br> At 1st level, the Spirit Trainer learns to incorporate their spirit into their turns more smoothly than other mortals. They gain 1 Spirit Action each turn. This action can be used to ask their spirit to take an action without cutting into their own actions for the turn.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Seeker"> Seeker  </b>
		<br> At 1st level, he gains a bonus equal to twice his Spirit Trainer level on diplomacy, sense motive, perception, and survival checks made to interact with and track spirits.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Spirit-Count"> Spirit Count </b>
		<br> At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the Trainer learns to expand his ability to connect to spirits. He can form a bond with an additional spirit, allowing them to reside within himself. He can sever this bond at any time, releasing his spirit partner into the world. <b>If he releases his starter spirit in this way, he never gets another starter spirit again</b>.
		<br> Though he can bond with 2 spirits, the Trainer can only have one spirit <b>active</b> at a time. The Active spirit can take actions and interact with the world, and is the one who resides in the trainer's shadow. The other spirit must remain dormant, sleeping through the power of Spirit Sleep as a <b>passive spirit</b>.
		<br> At 10th level, the trainer is able to keep 6 spirits within himself at a time. This is the maximum that a mortal can handle.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Spirit-Growth"> Spirit Growth </b>
		<br> As the bond between the Spirit Trainer and his partner grows, so too does the power of his partner. Through their interactions, the two learn to work together more effectively. At 2nd level, the Spirit Trainer can begin to work with his partners to teach them new moves.
		<br> These moves are of his own design, working with his partner to decide what new moves best accentuate their style. The Spirit learns these new moves by forgetting one of the 4 they already know.
		<br> Here is a summary of how teaching new moves works:
		<br><br> The Spirit Trainer must spend downtime working with their partner to perfect their new move.
		<br> Working with their partner functions as teaching others in downtime using the Instructor feat. When the tally reaches <b>150</b>, the Spirit Trainer completes their move. The Spirit Trainer adds 50 to the required tally for each additional move he wishes to teach a specific spirit. The new move must be conceptualized <b>BEFORE</b> the two begin work.
		<br> <b>(Example: It takes 150 to teach Ignis the Fire Spirit his first new move. The Trainer would have to reach 200 to teach him a second new move, but would still only have to reach 150 to teach Ventus the Wind Spirit her first new move).</b>
		<br> The Spirit Trainer himself can only keep track of so many new moves. This total is split amongst all the spirits he currently has bonds with. <b>The Trainer can know a number of new moves equal to his Spirit Trainer level.</b>
		<br> <b>(Example: Tom is a level 4 Spirit Trainer with 3 spirits, Ignis the Fire Spirit, Ventus the Wind Spirit, and Teras the Earth Spirit. Tom has worked with Ignis, teaching him 2 new moves, and Ventus, teaching her 1 new move. Tom can only keep track of 4 new moves, since half of his level is 4. Thus, if he wants to work with Teras, he can only teach her up to one new move at this level. If Ventus is dissipated in battle, the move he taught her is no longer relevant. He can now work with Teras to teach her 2 moves, if he wishes.)</b>

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Restorative-Ritual"> Restorative Ritual </b>
		<br> At 3rd level, the Spirit Trainer learns how to aid his spirits in their recovery. At the start or end of a day, depending on the spirit, the trainer can surround himself and one of his spirits with something that comforts them. If he does this, the spirit’s bond gains an additional number of HP equal to 5 per Spirit Trainer level.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Spirit-Fighter"> Spirit Fighter </b>
		<br> At 3rd level, the Spirit Trainer learns to apply his skills with spirits to help protect himself against them.
		<br> When the Spirit Trainer is in combat against spirits, he is more aware of how to fight them and how to resist them. He gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls, ac, and saves against spirits.
		<br> This bonus increases by +2 every three levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 9th level.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Onboard"> Onboard </b>
		<br> At 4th level, the Spirit Trainer learns to make use of their passive spirit’s abilities. He may choose to designate one passive spirit as “Onboard.” When a spirit is Onboard, they help strengthen their trainer without needing to be active.
		<br> A different spirit can be switched into the Onboard slot by casting Spirit Switch.
		<br> Each spirit has a set of 4 boons they can grant to their trainer while they are Onboard. They can only grant one at a time, and the bonus can be switched once as an action on his turn. Each spirit has one boon of the following 4 types.
		<ul>
			<li> Attack: These boons increase the trainer’s attack capability in some way. </li>
			<li> Defense: These boons increase the trainer’s defenses in some way. </li>
			<li> Mobility: These boons increase the trainer’s mobility in some way. </li>
			<li> Special: These boons vary in use, but they are generally more powerful and <b>may only be used for a number of rounds per day equal to your Spirit Trainer level</b>. </li>
		</ul>



		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Spirit-Management"> Spirit Management </b>
		<br> At 5th level, the Spirit Trainer learns how to maintain two active spirits simultaneously.
		<br> The Spirit Trainer may request moves from any and all of his active spirits, but must spend an action for each one individually (So if he has two spirits out, he has to spend two actions if he wants them both to do moves).
		<br> The <b>Spirit Action can allow only one of the active spirits to act</b>.
		<br> At 9th level, the Spirit Trainer gains the ability to manage one more. At this point, with the ability to manage 3 active spirits at once, the Trainer has attained the highest level of mastery mortals can achieve over spirit management.



		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Amicable"> Amicable </b>
		<br> At 7th level, the Spirit Trainer's interactions with spirits have led him to become more socially capable. He gains a bonus on diplomacy and sense motive made with the intent to keep the peace equal to his Spirit Trainer level.



		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Always-Onboard"> Always Onboard </b>
		<br> At 7th level, the Spirit Trainer’s bond with their Starter Spirit becomes so potent that, as long as they are not dissipated or Active, the Spirit Trainer gains one of their Onboard Boons.
		<br> This boon follows all the rules of the normal Onboard boons, but does not take up the Onboard slot.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Capstone"> Power of the Spirits </b>
		<br> At 10th level, the Spirit Trainer gains the ability to unleash the true power of his team. Once per day, he may choose to use the full Power of his Starter in the form of their Signature Move. After doing this, the Starter becomes passive for 10 minutes during which they do not grant onboard bonuses.
