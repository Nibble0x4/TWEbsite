	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> The Hoplite </b>
	<br> In the eastern plains of Taria stands the legendary Tri-Villages, three villages that have spent generations raising master warriors specializing in different kinds of warfare.
	<br> From the nothernmost Tri-Village, Morta, come the Hoplites. These men and woman have dedicated their lives to studying and mastering the combat style set forth by their great founder, Mortran. 
	<br> Mortran famously used for different stances in combat, heightening his skills to levels previously only attained through the use of magic. These four stances are now known as the four Disciplines and are the foundation of a hoplite's training.
	<br> Sponsored and guided by the goddess Artemis, the hoplites train to become masters of just a few of Mortran's legendary abilities.
	<br> Before they can be trained, hoplites must prove themselves. They often are trained as fighters, barbarians, rangers, cavaliers, or even rogues before coming to receive the title of hoplite.

	<br><br><b>Role</b>: As a Prestige Class, Hoplites are always adventurers with some measure of experience prior to their training in Morta.
	<br>Because of this, they can have a variety of backgrounds. However, they are typically best if they are intelligent with a solid physical skillset and extensive combat training.
	<br>Fighters are the most common and natural fit, due to their natural mastery of martial weapon groups.
	<br>Magi are common as hoplites. They must train longer to meet the combat experience requirement, but their natural bent toward the academic lends itself to greater control as a hoplite.
	<br>Rangers may have gained skills by focusing on polearms with their combat styles, and they are not uncommon as hoplites.
	<br>Rogues, like magi, must train longer but often find themselves fitting in well with their cleverness and affinity for the Moon stance.
	<br>Cavaliers often favor longer polearms naturally, and may be drawn to hoplite to complement their leadership and martial prowess, especially with the Huntress stance.
	<br>Finally, the door to hoplite training swings open to anyone willing to put in the effort. It is uncommon for other classes, perhaps, but not unheard of!

		<br> A Hoplite gains proficiency with all polearm weapons that have reach, but does not gain any armor or shield proficiencies.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Polearm-Dedication"> Polearm Dedication </b>
		<br> Hoplites are exclusive in their use of polearm weapons. None of their hoplite abilities can be used unless he is wielding a polearm weapon with the Reach trait.
		<br>However, they are also capable of handling any polearm. They gain proficiency with any polearm weapon they find, though they can still take penalties if they fail to meet the requirements for wielding it.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Disciplines"> Disciplines </b>
		<br> The training of the hoplite is rigorous, but even amongst their ranks there are different traditions. Different practitioners emphasize different skills in combat.
		<br> Masters of different skills have formed Disciplines, cauterizing the arts that allow their masters to perform martial feats unique to them.
		<br><br> At 1st level, a hoplite chooses one of the Disciplines and gains rank 1 in it.
		<br> At each level afterward, he chooses one of the Disciplines and increases his rank in that Discipline by 1, or gains rank 1 in a Discipline he does not already have.
		<br><br> Each Stance takes 1 action to enter and grants the following:
		<br>Access to abilities and bonuses from the corresponding discipline

		<ol>
				<li><b><u>Controlled Strike (1)</u></b> - As a swift action, a hoplite can spend 1 point from his Control pool to add his Intelligence modifier to an attack roll.</li>

		</ol>


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Moment-of-Respite"> Moment of Respite </b>
		<br>At 4th level, hoplites learn to take advantage of the peace that comes after a hard-fought victory to replenish their minds.
		<br>After a battle is complete, the hoplite can restore half of the Control Points he spent in the battle (Rounding down).


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Legendary-Maneuver"> Legendary Maneuver </b>
		<br>When a hoplite becomes level 10, their skills ascend into legend. For every style they have attained mastery of, they gain access to the Legendary Maneuver for that style.
		<br>If a hoplite has mastered multiple styles, they gain access to multiple Legendary Maneuvers. However, using a Legendary Maneuver causes such strain to the body that he cannot use another in the same turn.
		<br>In order to use a Legendary Maneuver, the hoplite must be in the corresponding stance.
		<br><br>OR
		<br><br>Alternatively, a hoplite can choose to eschew Legendary Maneuvers and gain 2 additional ranks to put into Disciplines of his choice.


		<br><br> <b>At first level</b>, the Hoplite selects <b>two runes</b> from the <a href="HopliteSubpages/rune-list.html">Rune Archives</a> as ones that she knows. She can learn new runes by <b>finding them in the world</b> of TWE or by <b>levelling up</b> as a Hoplite.
		<br> <b>At every new Hoplite level, she learns 1 new rune</b>.
		<br>
		<br> Tracing a rune normally takes 2 actions and requires the Hoplite to use some sort of drawing implement.
		<br> In order to trace a rune, a medium must be selected. There are 5 total mediums, though not every rune is suited to every medium.
		<ol>
				<li><b><u>Air</u></b> - This medium requires nothing more than the finger of the tracer and is very quick. Tracing a rune this way takes only 1 action and may not cost any RE. Runes traced in this way dissipate immediately after being used. If their effects last more than one turn, then the rune appears on the surface of whatever was created as a result of the rune.</li>
				<li><b><u>Surface</u></b> - Any solid surface capable of bearing writing (the ground, sand, glass, a wall, etc) can bear a rune. Runes traced on a surface are not singular runes only. Instead, 2d6 are rolled when the Hoplite begins to trace a Surface rune. They spend the RE cost when they trace the first rune, but can then inscribe a number of surface runes up to the rolled result without spending any additional RE. All runes must be within 20 feet of at least one other rune. The area included within these runes is used to create the effect the moment all the runes are complete. </li>
				<li><b><u>Weapon</u></b> - Runes can be traced on a weapon, infusing it with power. Most weapons cannot handle more than one rune on them without becoming unstable. </li>
				<li><b><u>Apparel</u></b> - Runes can be traced on clothing, armor, and accessories. Anything worn could potentially receive a rune if it is large enough.</li>
				<li><b><u>Item</u></b> - Any item that is not included in the above categories counts as an Item and can be infused with a rune as well.</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="body-text"><br> A rune inscribed on a surface, weapon, apparel, or item can be <b>destroyed</b> by dealing physical damage to it. A rune has a number of <b>HP equal to twice the creator's Hoplite level</b>.
		<br> In addition, a rune can be <b>disenchanted</b> by a dispel magic spell or by being magically erased. Doing so requires a <b>caster level check</b> opposed to a <b>DC of 10 + Twice the Hoplite's Hoplite level + the Hoplite's Int + the RE invested in the rune</b>.
		<br> If a rune calls for a <b>save</b>, the <b>DC</b> is equal to <b>10 + the RE stored in the rune + the Hoplite's Int modifier</b>.
		<br> Some runes have features that may modify this, granting extra ways to be disenchanted or making them more resilient in some way.
	</p>

		<br><br>
		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Runic-Energy"> Runic Energy </b>
		<br> The Hoplite gains a pool of energy equal to <b>twice her Hoplite level plus her intelligence modifier (min 1)</b>.
		<br> This energy is spent in order to empower and sustain Runes. These points are allotted to a rune when the rune is traced and can be recalled as a swift action, leaving the rune inert.
		<br> Runic Energy (RE) remains in a rune until it is recalled or the rune is destroyed or disenchanted by another. If the tracer is knocked unconscious or even killed, the RE remains in the rune until one of these things occur.

		<br> For the most part, any points spent from this pool are returned upon the destruction or disenchantment of one of the Hoplite's runes. However, there are some effects that call for the Hoplite to 'Burn' her RE.
		<br> Each day, when she is preparing her spells, the Hoplite can <b>regain a number of burnt RE equal to her Hoplite level</b>.

		

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Shorthand"> Shorthand </b>
		<br> At 2nd level and every two levels thereafter, the Hoplite learns a shorthand trick that helps her to do her work more efficiently. Choose one from the list of <a href="HopliteSubpages/shorthand-list.html">Hoplite Shorthands</a>.
		<br> temp list blehp: Runic Energy Expansion - Gain 2 more RE.
Reflexive Trace - Can spend an attack of opportunity to Air trace a 0 RE rune as an immediate action when that rune may be needed. I.E. An attack or save or something.
Uncapped Spellruning - When you use Spellruning to increase the Caster Level of the spell, remove any phrases in the spell that put a limit on how high the Caster Level can go.
Combat Tracer - Do not provoke AoO when you trace.
		

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Spellruning"> Spellruning </b>
		<br> At 3rd level, the Hoplite learns to use her runes to enhance her other spellcasting.
		<br> As an <b>immediate action when the Hoplite casts a spell</b>, she may trace a singular rune as part of the somatic components of the spell. If the spell does not have somatic components, one is added.
		<br> Doing this is called <b>'runing a spell.'</b> Runing a spell can only be done with a rune that matches the spell type or subtype in some way (Example: An Ash rune could be used to rune a 'Burning Hands' spell, but not a 'Feather Fall' spell.)
		<br> Runing a spell requires the Hoplite to <b>Burn 1 RE</b> from her pool.
		<br><br> When a spell has been successfully Runed, choose one of the following bonuses:
		<ol>
			<li>Increase the <b>Caster Level</b> of the spell by 1. </li>
			<li>Increase the <b>DC</b> of the spell by 1. </li>
			<li>Increase the <b>number of possible targets</b> by 1. </li>
		</ol>

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Runic-Research"> Runic Research </b>
		<br> At 5th level, the Hoplite has become so skilled at tracing that she is ready to try her hand at discovery. During downtime, she can roll <b>Spellcraft</b> to make progress on researching a new rune.
		<br> Once her research has attained a total of <b>200</b>, she may work with the DM to discover a brand new rune not yet included in the Rune Archive. She can choose whether to share her research, adding the new rune to the Archive, or not. If her research is stolen, she retains knowledge of the rune but it will not be exclusive to her anymore.

		<br><br> For every successful rune she discovers, the total she must attain to discover a new rune <b>increases by 100</b>.

	<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Spelltracing"> Spelltracing </b>
		<br> At 7th level, the Hoplite has become adept at capturing the essence of magic in runic form. Whenever she observes a spell being cast, she may make a <b>spellcraft check</b> with a <b>DC equal to 10 + the caster level of the caster + the level of the spell</b>.
		<br> If she succeeds, she has an idea of how to trace the spell. She can then choose to spend 1 full-round action and <b>burn RE equal to twice the level of the spell</b> in order to trace a rune containing the essence of the spell upon a surface. If she does not do this within <b>1d4 rounds</b>, she loses her idea.

		<br><br> The rune containing the essence of the spell is volatile, and will react unpredictably if destroyed. The rune can be activated as an action, releasing the spell. If the rune still contains the spell, it can be studied and the spell within learned as if it were written in a wizard's spellbook.
