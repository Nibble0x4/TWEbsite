	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> The Hoplite </b>
	<br> In the eastern plains of Taria stands the legendary Tri-Villages, three villages that have spent generations raising master warriors specializing in different kinds of warfare.
	<br> From the nothernmost Tri-Village, Morta, come the Hoplites. These men and woman have dedicated their lives to studying and mastering the combat style set forth by their great founder, Mortran. 
	<br> Mortran famously used for different stances in combat, heightening his skills to levels previously only attained through the use of magic. These four stances are now known as the four Disciplines and are the foundation of a hoplite's training.
	<br> Sponsored and guided by the goddess Artemis, the hoplites train to become masters of just a few of Mortran's legendary abilities.
	<br> Before they can be trained, hoplites must prove themselves. They often are trained as fighters, barbarians, rangers, cavaliers, or even rogues before coming to receive the title of hoplite.

	<br><br><b>Role</b>: As a Prestige Class, Hoplites are always adventurers with some measure of experience prior to their training in Morta.
	<br>Because of this, they can have a variety of backgrounds. However, they are typically best if they are intelligent with a solid physical skillset and extensive combat training.
	<br>Fighters are the most common and natural fit, due to their natural mastery of martial weapon groups.
	<br>Magi are common as hoplites. They must train longer to meet the combat experience requirement, but their natural bent toward the academic lends itself to greater control as a hoplite.
	<br>Rangers may have gained skills by focusing on polearms with their combat styles, and they are not uncommon as hoplites.
	<br>Rogues, like magi, must train longer but often find themselves fitting in well with their cleverness and affinity for the Moon stance.
	<br>Cavaliers often favor longer polearms naturally, and may be drawn to hoplite to complement their leadership and martial prowess, especially with the Huntress stance.
	<br>Finally, the door to hoplite training swings open to anyone willing to put in the effort. It is uncommon for other classes, perhaps, but not unheard of!

		<br> A Hoplite gains proficiency with all polearm weapons that have reach, but does not gain any armor or shield proficiencies.

		<br> Hoplites are exclusive in their use of polearm weapons. None of their hoplite abilities can be used unless he is wielding a polearm weapon with the Reach trait.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader" id="Disciplines"> Disciplines </b>
		<br> The training of the hoplite is rigorous, but even amongst their ranks there are different traditions. Different practitioners emphasize different skills in combat.

		<br><br> At 1st level, a hoplite chooses one of the Disciplines and gains rank 1 in it.
		<br> At each level afterward, he chooses one of the Disciplines and increases his rank in that Discipline by 1, or gains rank 1 in a Discipline he does not already have.
		<br><br> Each Stance takes 1 action to enter and grants the following:

		<br>In order to use a Legendary Maneuver, the hoplite must be in the corresponding stance.
		<br><br>OR
		<br><br>Alternatively, a hoplite can choose to eschew Legendary Maneuvers and gain 2 additional ranks to put into Disciplines of his choice.
