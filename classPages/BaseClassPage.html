<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Base Classes </b>
	<br> The Base Classes are more complex than their Core friends. They represent different ideas and fresh takes, but they all draw from the ideas and mechanics at play in the Core Classes. The classes tend to present a slightly diminished version of the Core classes along with a unique idea or theme or mechanic that is added in to make it all feel fresh and new and, coincidentally, more complicated.
	<br><br> These classes are suggested for players who have become familiar with the basics of the game and crave a deeper mechanical experience than they find in the Core Classes.
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist">Alchemist</a> </b>
		<br> The alchemist is what happens when you take a mad scientist and tell them about magic. Magic can, apparently, be placed in a test tube and Alchemists have plenty of it. They play with extracts (spells that are placed into potion bottles), mutagens (steroid injections), and even bombs that can be tossed at their enemies. The Alchemist is a tough one to predict, and they thrive off of it.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner">Summoner</a> </b>
		<br> The summoner is a specialist in exactly what it sounds like. He can summon creatures from the furthest extent of reality to do his bidding and fight for him. While he can summon hordes of creatures to help him in battle, he has one true ally in his Eidolon, an extradimensional creature with which he has formed a bond and whose form he can mold and shape to fit his will. The Eidolon is like an animal companion, but it cannot die. Instead, it is simply temporarily banished back to its home plane of existence until the Summoner summons it again. 

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch">Witch</a> </b>
		<br> Witches are the masters of fringe magic. They are often mistaken for wizards, since they cast in a manner that is practically identical, the magic they know is stored in the mind of a familiar instead of a spellbook. In addition, they trade their years of magical experience and wealth of knowledge for hexes, magic tricks that can be used more regularly and for spells that can curse and debilitate their foes. A witch is less likely to burn you to death with a fireball than she is to systematically remove your senses and cause your flesh to shrivel and die.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle">Oracle</a> </b>
		<br> Magic is seen as a boon, but the Oracle knows that that is not always purely the case. The Oracle did not choose her power, her power chose her. Much like the Oracle at Delphi, the unknown power of the divinities that don't wish to reveal themselves brings both aid and pain. Oracles gain power in the form of a Mystery, but it is always accompanied by a Curse as well. The Curse limits her abilities, but the Oracle eventually learns to use even that to her advantage after she spends enough time toiling with it. 

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/inquisitor">Inquisitor</a> </b>
		<br> Inquisitors are an interesting breed of divine caster. They serve a deity like a cleric would, but they are less interested in wielding their god's divine power and more interested in punishing those who oppose that deity. Inquisitors exceed in dicovering truth and meting out judgment to those they deem deserving. They do not wield as much magical might as a cleric, but they augment that with martial prowess to ensure that they can hunt down any and every offender and bring them to whatever kind of justice their deity prefers.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/shifter">Shifter</a> </b>
		<br> Shifters saw the Druids turn into animals and thought "I can do that, but better." Shifters are highly efficient warriors with the power to change their bodies to reflect aspects of animals from nature. A shifter might morph his hands into tiger claws, leap high into the air with frog legs and then begin soaring as an eagle. He might call upon the strength of a bull or the speed of an antelope and the reflexes of a snake. He might throw caution to the wind and transform his entire body into a bear to fight his foes. Whatever his opponent, the shifter can adapt his form and his strategy to fight them. He cannot cast spells, but he makes do without such things.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/cavalier">Cavalier</a> </b>
		<br> Cavaliers dedicate themselves to a cause more than to a fighting style. They tend to excel at mounted combat, but they truly shine on the battlefield when priorities are questioned. They carry a banner with them to encourage their allies, call out orders to help comrades fight together in a coordinated effort, and challenge specific foes who they deem particularly problematic. The cavalier specializes in controlling the flow of battle to ensure that his purpose is fulfilled and his allies see victory.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger">Gunslinger</a> </b>
		<br> The Gunslinger is a fresh and burgeoning style of combatant that, like the weapons he wields, has yet to be proven. He is a rare breed of warrior wielding a weapon few have ever seen at this point in TWE, and this means the gunslingers out there have to have a solid amount of grit to them. They carry weapons that can backfire and explode at any time, and yet they use them anyway. They see the future of warfare and they intend to pioneer it.
