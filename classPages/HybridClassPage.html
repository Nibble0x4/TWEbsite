<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Hybrid Classes </b>
	<br> The Hybrid Classes are classes made up entirely of the combination of two existing classes from the Core or Base classes. Each of them have two parent classes, and play as a hybrid of the two. 
	<br><br> These classes are for those who enjoy the concepts shown in Core and Base classes, but wish to have several of them at the same time. Players who like the odea of mashing two character types into one will have a blast with hybrid classes.
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist">Arcanist</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Wizard and Sorcerer.</b> The Arcanist combines the intellect of a wizard with the innate powers of the sorcerer's bloodline to become the most versatile caster in existence. Arcanists cast spells like a wizard, but have powers in their blood that lets them break the rules of magic with things called Exploits. With these, Arcanists can cast spells in ways that no other mage could dream of.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/shaman">Shaman</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Oracle and Witch.</b> The Shaman truly exhibits the best of both worlds. Combining the reliability of the witch's hexes and the divine power of the Oracle, the Shaman eschews any Curse for the favor of Spirits who follow her around and grant her new powers whenever she wishes it. It pays to be friends with the spirits, and the Shaman is a fearful foe for exactly that reason.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus">Magus</a> </b>
		<br>  <b>Parent Classes: Wizard and Fighter.</b> The Magus is a student of both blade and book, spear and spell, armor and the arcane. For he who wishes to cast spells in the most direct way possible, the Magus provides Spellstrike. A Magus can imbue his weapon with spells from his book and unleash its power by striking his opponents down with it. The Magus combines the martial prowess of the fighter with the intellectual spellcasting of the wizard to become a deadly blur of magic and might.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/bloodrager">Bloodrager</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Barbarian and Sorcerer.</b> The Bloodrager takes the sheer power of the barbarian and combines it with the bloodline powers of the sorcerer. Instead of focusing on casting spells in addition to smacking their enemies, the bloodrager lets the power of their blood manifest in their rage. A bloodrager may not cast many spells in battle, but their ferocious rage will be magical enough to help them see to your demise.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/warpriest">WarPriest</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Cleric and Fighter.</b> The Warpriest is what happens when a cleric yearns for battle. While clerics are no slouches in the combat department, warpriests take it several steps further. Their spellcasting is not as extensive as their more traditional brothers and sisters, but warpriests gain the ability to enhance their sacred weapons and armor with the might of their god and either heal or harm with their fervor alone.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/hunter">Hunter</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Druid and Ranger.</b> The Hunter is what happens if you take the Druid and the Ranger, combine their skills, and make them really care about their animal companion. The Hunter can cast more spells than Rangers and less than Druids, but their survival skills surpass either one. They form sucha  close bond with their companion that they learn to extend their magic to strengthen them and fight at their side in different well-practiced Forms that enhance their fighting prowess.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/skald">Skald</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Bard and Barbarian.</b> The Bardbarian (Skald) is an entertainer who focuses less on the traditional happy feelings that come from a bard's music and focus on inspriting something more primal. Her performances bring to mind the heat of battle and glorious victory, inciting a battle frenzy akin to a barbarian's rage within the hearts of her hearers. She cares more for the history and lore for the world around her, seeking to not only learn it, but to record it herself and pass it to others.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator">Investigator</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Alchemist and Rogue.</b> The Investigator combines the curiosity and quick-wittedness of the rogue with the curiosity and in-depth analysis of the alchemist to create the most adaptive mind and learned body around. The Investigator excels in using their quick mind and reflexes to analyze the situation before them and come up with an inspired plan to solve whatever problems they face.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/swashbuckler">Swashbuckler</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Gunslinger and Fighter.</b> The Swashbuckler is the epitome of style and finesse in melee combat. They specialize only in the use of light or one-handed melee piercing weapons, and thus are more limited in their weapon use, but are incredibly proficient with their blades of choice. The Swashbuckler brings to mind images of a suave and dashing combatant with an elegant rapier and a confident smirk deftly parrying his opponent and relieving them of their weapon. The Swashbuckler thrives on style and panache, using successes to fuel further daring deeds.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/slayer">Slayer</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Rogue and Ranger.</b> The Slayer is, for all intents and purposes, an assassin. She combines the hunting and tracking capabilities of the ranger with the stealth and disguise skills of the rogue to create the worst nightmare of anyone with a target on their backs. She pays close attention in battle, studying specific targets to enable greater precision and damage against them.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/brawler">Brawler</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Monk and Fighter.</b> The Brawler is what happens when a monk sees no value in mysticism and turns to the possibility of using other weapons beyond their fists. While the Brawler is plenty capable with their unarmed attacks, he can seemlessly transition between his fists and a blade he just picked up off the ground. Like the fighter whose wide breadth of combat experience allows her to collect more feats than any other class, the Brawler gains the ability to swap feats out mid-fight to essentially shift between self-created styles to fit the current battle.
