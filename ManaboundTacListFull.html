		<div class="classFeature">
			<br><br><b class="iceSubHeader">Ice Chop [ 1 Mana ] [ BASIC ]</b>
			<br> Form small icicles on your hand and chop your foe.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as part of an unarmed strike. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 piercing damage + 1 cold damage and the target suffers -1 to CMB and CMD until the start of your next turn. These debuffs do stack.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 cold damage add -1 to the CMB and CMD debuff.

			<br><br><br><b class="iceSubHeader">Ice Them- [ 5 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Conjure as much cold as you can and fill your opponent with it, shutting them down and subduing them immediately.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as an action. If there is a prone or helpless creature within reach, you may make a CMB grapple against them. If you succeed, they make a fortitude save or else fall unconscious and cease all internal processes. While they are like this, their bodies do not age, think, act, poisons and diseases are halted, and they are completely stiff. You may keep them like this as long as you spend 1 Mana each turn. At any time during this, you may choose to end their life by unfreezing them wrong. When you wish for them to wake, you may release them and they will return to waking in 1 minute.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the DC by 1.
			
			<br><br><br><b class="iceSubHeader">Bone Chill- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Conjure cold to surround an enemy and chill them to their core, weakening them against your attacks.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as an action. Choose a target within 40 feet. If the target fails a fortitude save, their crit guard is reduced by 1 and they gain brittle bones, giving them Vulnerability 1 (Bludgeoning) for 1 round. You can maintain this effect next round by paying the mana cost.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the DC, crit guard reduction, and the Vulnerability (B) by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="iceSubHeader">Bitter Cold- [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Focus the cold on yourself, sapping the warmth from the air nearby and channeling to keep some warm and freeze others who would strain themselves.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as an action or as part of casting another Ice Tac. For 1 round, you are surrounded by a 15 foot radius zone of cold. This can be maintained as a free action next turn by spending the mana cost. All who would enter or start their turn in this area must succeed at a fortitude save or else suffer 1 cold damage for every attack, spell, or step they take beyond 5 feet in one action. If a spellcaster fails the save, they cannot cast a spell in the area if that spell has Somatic components. For each time that a creature is reintroduced to the cold and for each time that Bitter Cold is maintained, they must roll a new save.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the DC and the damage by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="iceSubHeader">Coldtrops- [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Manifest cold in the form of many small, razor sharp icicle caltrops and cast them around.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as an action, or as a part of casting another Ice Tac. You generate enough coldtrops to cover 4 squares. You may choose any squares within 30 feet to place them, provided they are not blocked. Occupied spaces do not count as blocked. Any creature who moves into or out of a space with coldtrops as a part of any movement that is more than 5 feet takes 1 point of cold damage and has their movement speed halved for 1 turn.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the damage by 1 and the number of squares you can fill by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="iceSubHeader">FrostBite- [ 4 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Reach deep into your foe, pulling forth as much of their crucial inner warmth as you can and consuming it.
			<br>
			This Tac takes an action to cast, and requires a successful Steal maneuver to strike. If the maneuver hits, you deal 1d6 + 1 cold damage plus extra based on how many debuffs are currently on the opponent. If:
			<br>Halved movement- 1 more damage and 1 more point of healing
			<br>CMB or CMD reduction- 1 more damage and 1 more point of healing
			<br>Vulnerability- 1 more damage and 1 more point of healing
			<br>Crit Guard Reduced- 1 more damage and 1 more point of healing
			<br>Any other debuffs- 1 more damage and 1 more point of healing
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the base damage by 1d6+1 and the damage and healing for each of the debuff effects by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="iceSubHeader">Freezer Burn- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Grip your opponent for just a moment, searing their skin with cold before letting them go once more.
			<br>
			This Tac takes an action to cast and requires a successful grapple maneuver to strike. If the maneuver succeeds, you grab your enemy and deal 2 points of cold damage with your hands before letting them go. In the place you grabbed them, their skin has been burned. For 1 round, they have Vulnerability 1 (Cold). You store the heat from their skin, so the next Water Tac you cast within 1 minute gains Steam Power 1.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the cold damage by 2, the Vulnerability (Cold) by 1, and the Steam Power by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="iceSubHeader">StalagmIce- [ 0 Mana ] [ EXCLUSIVE ]</b>
			<br> Conjure ice nearby, within 30 feet, causing a spire to jut up in any unoccupied square.
			<br>
			For 1 turn, this Ice spire exists as a solid surface with 10 ac and hp equal to half your current hp. Anyone who falls onto the tip of this spire takes extra fall damage as if they had fallen 30 extra feet. This Tac can be cast as an action or as part of another ice Tac. This Tac can only be cast once per round.

			<br> 
		<div class="classFeature">
			<br><br><b class="acidSubHeader">Acid Jab [ 1 Mana ] [ BASIC ]</b>
			<br> Jab your foe, acid dripping from your hand.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as part of an unarmed strike. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 + 1 acid damage and reduces the ac of the target’s armor or natural armor or shield by 1 until the start of your next turn. If the target has no armor bonus, instead double the acid damage dealt by this attack.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 acid damage and 1 to the ac reduction.

			<br><br><br><b class="acidSubHeader">Toxic Deluge- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Conjure a glob of specialized acid and send it to cover an opponent nearby.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as an action, and its effects last 1 turn. If the target fails a reflex save, their elemental resistances are reduced by 1. If they are immune to an element, they take 1 step backward instead. (If they heal from damage, they are immune. If they are immune, they halve. If they halve, they now have resistance equal to their level that can be reduced) This damage can stack, up to reducing the target’s resistance to 0.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the DC by 1, and the resistance reduction by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="acidSubHeader">Consuming Strike- [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Spying an opening in your foe’s defenses, strike with acid primed to eat away at their exposed flesh.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as a part of an unarmed strike. If the target has no armor bonus, then deal an additional 2d6+2 acid damage.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the damage by 1d6+1.

			<br><br><br><b class="acidSubHeader">Gear Hungry- [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Conjure a dripping coat of acid in your hand, and reach out for an opponent’s weapon, tool, armor, or shield in an attempt to ruin it.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as a part of a Disarm maneuver. If it is successful, deal 1d4+1 damage to the target item. This damage bypasses the item’s hardness, and if it reduces its hp to half, then the item gains the broken condition. If it reduces the hp of the item to 0, then the item is destroyed and becomes useless.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the damage by 1 and add 1 to your CMB to disarm.

			<br><br><br><b class="acidSubHeader">Toxic Cloud- [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Take a deep breath and exhale, allowing poisonous gas to spill out of your mouth and form an orb that, when broken, fills the area with a purplish haze.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as an action. Select a space with 10 feet and throw the ball of gas there. Until the start of your next turn, the area within 10 feet of this location is filled with poisonous gas. Any creature who enters the area or starts their turn there must make a fortitude save or else gain 1 sickened level. The sickness lasts until they have a chance to take a long rest, and stacks up to 1.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the DC by 1 and the maximum stack level by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="acidSubHeader">Blob Body- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Cover your body with excess acid, hoping to burn anyone foolish enough to strike you.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as an action and lasts 1 round, though it can be maintained as a free action next turn by paying the mana cost. When an enemy strikes you and deals damage with a physical melee attack or touch attack, the acid splashes off a bit and deals 1 point of acid damage to anyone within 5 feet. If this Tac is active, Earth Armor cannot be active on you, lest it be dissolved.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the damage by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="acidSubHeader">Acid Spit- [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Spit forth a glob of toxic sludge from your mouth at your opponent. 
			<br>
			Depending on where it strikes them, they may suffer a variety of negative effects. Make a ranged touch attack at a target within 20 feet. If the attack hits, you deal 1d6+1 points of acid damage and roll a d4. If:
			<br>1- They are hit in the eyes and are blinded for 1 round.
			<br>2- They are hit in the mouth and cannot speak for 1 round.
			<br>3- They are hit in the arm and take -1 on attack rolls for 1 round.
			<br>4- They are hit in the body and have their crit guard reduced by 1 for 1 round.

			<br> Strike your foe with an elbow wreathed in electricity.
			<br>

			<br> Build electricity in your limbs then reach out and touch a creature, filling them with charge and sending them plummeting to the ground.
			<br>
			Make a touch attack against the target. If they are airborne, they take 1d6+1 points of electric damage and immediately get pulled out of the sky down to the earth. For every 10 feet they fall, they take 1 electric damage, in addition to the regular fall damage that a creature such as they might take.

			<br>
			You may cast this Tac as an immediate action as a part of an unarmed strike that defeats an opponent. You gain in your body 1d8+2 electric damage that you store and do not take. This damage is not released until you are struck by an enemy attack, at which point all your built up electricity is released at all creatures within a 10 foot radius, with a reflex save to halve the damage.

			<br> Face down a single foe and unleash a flurry of increasingly charged strikes intended to wipe them out, personally. 
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as an immediate action after a successful unarmed strike involving an Electric Tac struck an enemy. You may make an unarmed strike against this foe at your highest Base Attack Bonus with a +1 electric damage. If your attack hits, you may do so again with a -4 attack modifier and an additional +1 electric damage more than your last hit. You may continue to do this until you miss.
