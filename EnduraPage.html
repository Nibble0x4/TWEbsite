	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> The Endura are a race with a wide variety of appearances. They begin life as a small orb similar to an egg. Instead of hatching, the egg slowly develops into a vaguely humanoid form. The form they take is highly influenced by what they admire as they develop and mature. As a result, Endura can range from 6-foot creatures to tiny beings, less than 2 feet tall. Endura do not have genders, as they each reproduce on their own, but often tend to resemble males or females based on who they admired during early development. Endura typically possess arms and legs, but those appendages are laughably weak. Their bodies are frail and spongy, with hair-like growths that are a specific length until otherwise cut. The core being of the Endura is in their head. As a result, they can potentially grow back large portions of their body over time. 


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> The Endura are rare. Few and often far-between, the Endura are the direct relatives of the Subdura. Unlike their savage kin, these beings have retained their intelligence and far more greatly portray the aspects that we identify as humanity. Rationality, mercy, a sense of duty, and other such features cause the Endura to appear far more human than they really are. The Endura believe themselves to be the protectors and moderators of the sea. Like the Subdura, they can go anywhere, regardless of depth. Unlike the Subdura, they are not predatory hunters. Their power and sea dominating abilities lie in their charm and calm, soothing presence. The Endura were historically delighted to learn of the presence of a civilized and often benevolent race of land-dwellers called humans, and made a pact with them in ancient times. The sea harbored dangers to human and Endura alike, so the Endura used their power to imbue willing humans with the spirit of the sea. These humans gained the power of the greatest sea creatures, and would accompany the comparatively weak and helpless Endura as they strove to bring balance and serenity to the depths of the sea. 

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Functionality </b>
		<br> The Endura are a very weak race. Their bodies are frail and slight, and they can be killed quite easily. They can move swiftly in the water, but that is often not enough to protect them. As a result, they use a latent power of telekinesis to interact with their surroundings when they need to be forceful. This telekinesis applies only to water that the Endura has filled with a cloudy film that is secreted from their body. This controlled water can be used to manipulate objects with more power than their body can hope to achieve. On land, they must carry water imbued with their secretion in order to remain hydrated. Their legs are unsure on land, so even those who are trained to move on land are slow for their size.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> These are the basic traits natural to Endura. Many of these will have differing options depending on whether your Fearthite is male or female.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>
		<br> Endura can be any of 3 different size categories. Endura have frail forms and tend to be rather weak. As a result, Endura adventurers begin play with -5 points for ability score allotment. Similar penalties apply to other stat-selection methods.
		<br><br> <u>Medium:</u>  -2 str, -2 con, +4 cha
		<br><br> <u>Small:</u>  -3 str, -3 con, +4 cha, +2 dex
		<br><br> <u>Tiny:</u>  -4 str, -4 con, +6 cha, +2 dex


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Base Speed </b>
		<br> Endura have different movement speeds in water and on land.
		<br><br> <u>Medium:</u>  50 feet in water, 15 feet on land
		<br><br> <u>Small:</u>  40 feet in water, 10 feet on land
		<br><br> <u>Tiny:</u>  30 feet in water, 5 feet on land

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>
		<br> Different Endura gain different effects based on their size.
		<br><br> <u>Medium:</u>  Medium, and thus gain no bonuses or penalties based on their size.
		<br><br> <u>Small:</u>  +1 to ac and attack rolls, +4 stealth, -1 to cmb and cmd. Use smaller damage dice.
		<br><br> <u>Tiny:</u>  +2 to ac and attack rolls, +8 stealth, -2 to cmb and cmd. Use even smaller damage dice.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Endura are magical beasts.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Defense Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br> <u>Magic Body:</u>  The bodies of the Endura May be squishy and weak, but aether’s grasp on them is loose. Similarly, Flux has less effect on their bodies. 
		<br> Spell resistance- they gain SR equal to 10 + 1/2 their character level.
		<br> Flux resistance- they gain DR equal to their character level against damage from Flux, and they gain a bonus of 1/4 their character level on saves against Flux effects.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Skill Traits </b>
		<br> Endura gain different skill penalties based on their size.
		<br><br> <u>Medium:</u>  They gain no penalties to any skills.
		<br><br> <u>Small:</u>  -4 on intimidate checks.
		<br><br> <u>Tiny:</u>  -8 on intimidate checks, +8 on ride checks.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Regenerative Traits </b>
		<br><br><u>Core Creature:</u> The Endura’s core is in their head. The rest of their body is a form grown from the core. If the Endura rests at full hp for an hour while submerged in salt water akin to the sea, they regenerate any lost limbs. 

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Magical Abilities </b>
		<br> These are the magical abilities gained by all Endura.
		<br><br><u>Hydrotelekinesis:</u> The Endura can control water that they have been in bodily contact with for 5 minutes or more by secreting their film. This water can be used as follows:
		<br> In water: The Endura can sustain Defense and Limbs simultaneously.
		<br> On land: If the Endura has sufficient water available, they can sustain either Defense or Limbs. Manifesting or switching manifestations is an action. When damaged, they must roll a concentration check or else lose the manifestation. A manifestation can also be sundered (DC=CMD with cha replacing str).
		<br><br> <b>Defense: </b>
		<br><br> <u>Medium:</u>  +5 to AC (or +7 underwater)
		<br><br> <u>Small:</u>  +4 to AC (or +7 underwater)
		<br><br> <u>Tiny:</u>  +3 to AC (or +7 underwater)
		<br><br> <b>Limbs:</b> The limbs can be used just as well as if they were attached. It has all the same physical stats as the Endura, except as noted below. In addition, land movement speeds are doubled while Limbs are active.
		<br><br> <u>Medium:</u>  +6 str, 10 foot reach
		<br><br> <u>Small:</u>  +4 str, 5 foot reach
		<br><br> <u>Tiny:</u>  +2 str. 5 foot reach. 
		<br><br><b><u>Shard Share:</u></b>At any time, an Endura may choose to fracture their core in order to impart life to a creature. When they do this, the Endura breaks off a piece of their core and imbues it into a creature within reach. Breaking off a piece of an Endura’s core deals irrevocable damage to it. When this occurs, the Endura permanently reduces their maximum hp by 1 per character level they have. If the creature accepts, or if the creature is unable to refuse, the creature is immediately returned to 0 hp and regains hp equal to (the hp lost by the Endura multiplied by the Endura’s Cha modifier). Any excess hp regained is converted into temporary hp that is lost on a long rest.
		<br><br><b><u>Song of the Sea:</u></b> When the Endura are deep in the sea, they can hear the whispers of the ocean. This helps them remain aware their surroundings beyond just their immediate sight. They have a chance of hearing about significant events, abnormal creatures, dangerous predators, and creatures in need of aid within approximately a mile of their location. In addition, the song soothes their souls and calms their minds, granting them +2 bonus on will saves.
		<br><br> <b><u>Duty Bond:</u></b>  Once in their life, an Endura can create a life-long bond with a creature. It requires the consent of the creature, or it must be enacted upon the creature when it is newborn. Creating the bond is a ritual that takes a week to complete. If the Endura performs the ritual without a target, the Bond is cast randomly throughout the world. The subject of the Bond gains a hybrid form of a sea creature, and extra power accordingly. These effects manifest themselves over time. The time taken varies. Proximity to the Endura is necessary for a healthy and safe transition. If the subject is separated from their Endura, they slowly begin to lose their humanity and rationality. If left unchecked, the subject may develop into a full-fledged sea monster. At that point, only the bonded Endura has any chance of controlling them. 

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Weakness Traits </b>
		<br><u>Head Core:</u> The Endura gains an additional bonus to their crit guard when strikes are made at their head. If a critical strike that deals piercing damage strikes them in the head, they are immediately brought to -1 hit points and begin dying. If they would already be brought to negative hit points by the damage, they instead die. If the Endura is unconscious and with negative hit points, any strike that deals piercing damage to their head immediately kills them. 
		<br><br> The bonus to crit guard: 
		<br><br> <u>Medium:</u>  +8
		<br><br> <u>Small:</u>  +6
		<br><br> <u>Tiny:</u>  +4
		<br><u>Land Wobbles:</u> On land, the Endura suffer a -4 penalty on CMB and CMD unless hydrotelekinesis limbs are active.
