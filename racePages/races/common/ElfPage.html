	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> Elven history among the people of TWE runs parallel to that of humans. Unlike in other worlds, elves do not live lives that dwarf the others in comparison. They grow old and die along with the other races around them. What sets them apart is their patience and serenity, living life with the long game always in view. They have a history of living alongside humans, favoring the natural world more so than the artificial, and always straining to look forward and see how their actions might impact future generations.
	<br><br> True Elves trace their history back further than humans...much further. These beings are also referred to as Precedents, and they bear no blood relation to the elves of today. 
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Generally taller than humans, elves possess a graceful, slender physique that is accentuated by their long, pointed ears. It is a mistake, however, to consider them weak or feeble, as the thin limbs of an elf can contain surprising power. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, and filled with large, vibrantly colored pupils. The coloration of elves as a whole varies wildly, and is much more diverse than that of human populations. However, as their coloration often matches their surroundings, the elves of a single community may appear quite similar. Forest-dwelling elves often have variations of green, brown, and tan in their hair, eye, and even skin tones.

While elven clothing often plays off the beauty of the natural world, those elves who live in cities tend to bedeck themselves in the latest fashions. Where city-dwelling elves encounter other urbanites, the elves are often fashion trendsetters.

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> Elf culture is very similar to human, except that it tends to consider itself higher as a result of their obsession with the future. The humans around them are industrious, building and training and tinkering and learning for the moment, but elves act far more slowly. They act with precision and poise, confident in the future ramifications of their careful actions. Thus, while elves often live in the same settlements as humans, they are often behind on the latest trends, fads, and developments. Some thinks this makes elves obsolete or out of style, but they are rarely surprised by the somewhat strange turns human history tends to make.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Functionality </b>
		<br> Elves are frail, making it dangerous for them to engage in melee combat, but their nimbleness and sharp minds make them excellent at sneaking around, aiming a shot, and conjuring powerful arcane spells.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> These are the basic traits natural to Elf

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>
		<br> Elves are nimble, both in body and mind, but their form is frail
		<br><br> +2 Dex, +2 Int, -2 Con.


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Base Speed </b>
		<br> Elves have a base speed of 30 feet on land.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>
		<br> Elves are Medium creatures and thus have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Elves are Humanoids with the elf subtype.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Defense Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br> <u>Sleep Immunity:</u>  Elves are immune to magic sleep effects.
		<br> <u>Enchantment Resistance:</u> Elves gain a +2 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells and effects.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Skill Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br> <u>Keen Senses:</u>  Elves receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks.
		<br><br> <u>Ear for Gossip:</u>  Elves receive a +2 racial bonus on Gossip checks using the Knowledge (Local) skill.
		<br><br> <u>Natural Attunement:</u> Elves appear all over TWE, but no matter where they hale from they exhibit a closeness to and fondness for the natural world that few other races can boast. Depending on where they were raised, they gain a different bonus:
		<br><br><i>Arctic Elf: </i> These elves come from the snowy colds of the north, usually Gruss. They ignore difficult terrain in the snow and gain Cold Resistance 5. In addition, their eyes are so accustomed to the glare of the sun on the snow that they are immune to the Dazzled and Dazed conditions. They gain a +2 bonus on survival checks in snowy or icy environments.
		<br><br><i>Wood Elf: </i> These elves come from the forested lands found all across TWE. They ignore difficult terrain brought about by plantlife. In addition, they are so accustomed to climbing and dropping from trees that they gain a +4 bonus on Climb checks and acrobatics checks to reduce fall damage when climbing or falling from plantlife. They gain a +2 bonus to stealth while in forests. They gain a +2 bonus on survival checks in arboreal environments.
		<br><br><i>Sea Elf: </i> These elves come from the coasts, rivers, lakes, and, of course, the sea. They have a swim speed of 20 feet and always treat Swim as a class skill. They cannot breathe underwater, but their habitual deep-dives for food and treasure have expanded their lungs, granting them the ability to hold their breath 10 times longer than humans. When calculating how long they can hold their breath, use the Sea Elf's intelligence score in place of their constitution score. They do not suffer any penalties for wielding a weapon or casting a spell underwater, even when drowning. They gain a +2 bonus on survival checks in water or on shorelines.
		<br><br><i>Urban Elf: </i> These elves come from highly urbanized locales, such as Great Enthan or Yanor in the Lake. These elves have become attuned to the flow and life of the city and its inhabitants rather than nature itself. They can move through crowds without treating them as difficult terrain. In addition, they gain a +2 bonus on Stealth checks made in settlements. When they are climbing or leaping from buildings, they gain a +4 bonus to Climb and Acrobatics checks. They have little to no difficulty pushing past people, and thus gain a +2 bonus on acrobatics checks when attempting to avoid attacks of opportunity provoked by movement.
		<br><br><i>Dusk Elf: </i> These elves come from dark places, often caves or excessively darkened woods. They gain darkvision, allowing them to see 60 feet through darkness, and ignore difficult terrain made a result of rocks, crags, or shifting earth. They also gain a +2 bonus on Climb and Acrobatics checks made to climb or fall from rocks. They gain a +2 bonus on perception and stealth checks when they are in the dark. 
		
		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Magical Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br> <u>Elven Magic:</u>  Elves receive a +2 racial bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance. In addition, elves receive a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (Arcana) skill checks.
		<br><br> <u>Cantrip:</u>  Elves choose a spellcasting type at level 1. They can choose from Arcane, Divine, Primal, or Occult. Depending on their choice, they gain one of the following elf-exclusive cantrips.
		<br><i>Arcane: </i> <b><a href="spells/elf/ArcaneMissile.html">Arcane Missile</a></b>
		<br><i>Divine: </i> <b><a href="spells/elf/DivineGaze.html">Divine Gaze</a></b>
		<br><i>Primal: </i> <b><a href="spells/elf/PrimalPulse.html">Primal Pulse</a></b>
		<br><i>Occult: </i> <b><a href="spells/elf/OccultWhispers.html">Occult Whispers</a></b>

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Offense Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br> <u>Weapon Familiarity:</u> Elves are proficient with longbows (including composite longbows), longswords, rapiers, and shortbows (including composite shortbows), and treat any weapon with the word “elven” in its name as a martial weapon.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Racial Senses </b>
		<br><br> <u>Low-Light Vision:</u> Elves can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.
