	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> Half-Elf history isn't often well-documented. They tend to follow the combined history of elves and humans, being deeply involved in both. They have been around as long as elves and humans have known each other, and they are unlikely to disappear at any foreseeable juncture.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Half-half-elves stand taller than humans but shorter than half-elves. They inherit the lean build and comely features of their elven lineage, but their skin color is normally dictated by their human side. While half-half-elves retain the pointed ears of half-elves, theirs are more rounded and less pronounced. Their eyes tend to be human-like in shape, but feature an exotic range of colors from amber or violet to emerald green and deep blue. This pattern changes for half-half-elves of drow descent, however. Such half-elves are almost unfailingly marked with the white or silver hair of the drow parent, and more often than not have dusky gray skin that takes on a purplish or bluish tinge in the right light, while their eye color usually favors that of the human parent.

While elven clothing often plays off the beauty of the natural world, those half-elves who live in cities tend to bedeck themshalf-elves in the latest fashions. Where city-dwelling half-elves encounter other urbanites, the half-elves are often fashion trendsetters.

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> Half-Elf culture is one of balance and strife. Half-Elf families tend to live anywhere, but they have difficulties adjusting to the differences between elven values and human values. The home is often unbalanced, as one parent's influence is more dominating on the family than the other. Strife between parents is common as long-looking elves and quick-working humans clash. Half-Elves, as a result, find themselves stuck somewhere in the middle. They may have appreciation for the values of each, or perhaps disdain, the choice is entirely up to the specific individuals.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Functionality </b>
		<br> Half-Elves are flexible. They do not possess quite as much versatility as their human ancestors or as much specialization as their elven ancestors, but they can still find ways to operate in just about any role imaginable. They struggle with taking larger hits, but that is not often enough to stop them.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> These are the basic traits natural to Half-Elf

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>
		<br> Half-Elves are reflective of the inherent abilities of both their human and elven heritage. As a result, they gain a bit from both.
		<br><br> +1 Dex, +1 Int, -1 Con, and a +1 bonus to any score of your choice.


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Base Speed </b>
		<br> Half-Elves have a base speed of 30 feet on land.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>
		<br> Half-Elves are Medium creatures and thus have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Half-Elves are Humanoids with both the human and elf subtypes.


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Split Heritage Pool </b>
		<br><br> Half-Elves gain traits from both their human and elven parents. However, as there is great variety amongst humans and elves individually, it follows that half-elves have even more potential for diversification. Half-Elves receive a pool of <b>4 points </b> they can spend at level 1 to create a unique half-elf that reflects the varied heritages of their parents. They can choose to spend these points on any combination of Human and Elf racial traits, as shown below.
		<br> <u>Enchantment Resistance:</u> Half-Elves gain a +2 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells and effects.


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Human Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br> Humans come in several varieties. Humans, Enthan Humans, Trian Humans, Arethian Humans, Grussian Humans, and Kun'Achi Humans. Each of these variants has different abilities to offer depending on where the human was raised. Please see the corresponding pages for details.
		<br><b> When selecting abilities from Human Variants, you must follow the same rules for selecting abilities as that race does. <u>EXAMPLE:</u> A half-elf cannot choose to take both an Imperial Combat Skill and a Regional Trait from Enthan Human. You also cannot take traits from two different sources of human, unless one of those sources is regular Human. </b>

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Elf Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br> Elves also come from different regions of TWE with a variety of abilities. These differences are not as pronounced as they are in humans, but they are still noteworthy. A Half-elf can spend points from their Heritage Pool to gain any of the abilities listed below, but they <b>cannot take abilities for different kinds of elves.</b>
		<br><br> <u><a href="ElfPage.html">Elf:</u>  </a>
			<br><br><b>Keen Senses and Ear for Gossip</b> 1 Point
			<br><br><b>Natural Attunement</b> 1 Point
			<br><br><b>Cantrip</b> 1 Points
