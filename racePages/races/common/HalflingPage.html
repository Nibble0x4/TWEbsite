	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> Halfling history among the people of TWE runs parallel to that of humans. Unlike in other worlds, halflings live about as long as humans do. They are a small, hearty, happy people who often finds themselves at the core of society, acting as the glue that holds the different races together, and also living their lives on the outskirts of cities where the simple farming life brings them great pleasure. You won't hear much about halflings in the history books, but that is because they are not often considered worthy subjects of writing. They are always there, smiling, bringing people together, and appreciating the ordinary things in life.
	<br><br> True Halflings trace their history back further than humans...much further. These beings are also referred to as Precedents, and they bear no blood relation to the halflings of today. 
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Halflings rise to a humble height of 3 feet. They prefer to walk barefoot, leading the bottoms of their feet to become roughly calloused. Tufts of thick, curly hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet.
	<br>Their skin tends toward a rich cinnamon color and their hair toward light shades of brown. A halfling’s ears are pointed, but proportionately not much larger than those of a human.
	>br>Halflings prefer simple and modest clothing. Though willing and able to dress up if the situation demands it, their racial urge to remain quietly in the background makes them rather conservative dressers in most situations. Halfling entertainers, on the other hand, make their livings by drawing attention, and tend to go overboard with gaudy and flashy costumes.

While elven clothing often plays off the beauty of the natural world, those elves who live in cities tend to bedeck themselves in the latest fashions. Where city-dwelling elves encounter other urbanites, the elves are often fashion trendsetters.

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> Halfling culture is very similar to human, except that it tends to slip away unnoticed, building the background and the 'ordinary.' Halflings are a common sight in smaller settlements, farming and dealing in the mundane but satisfying work of everyday life. In cities, they are easily overlooked both physically and socially as they tend to focus their time and energy into dealing with people. They rarely are at the forefront of innovation, learning, politics, or construction. Instead, they hold societies together with friendly faces, well-placed encouragement, and tightnit communities that watch out for each other.
