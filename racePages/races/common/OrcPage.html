	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> Orcish history in TWE is a rocky one. They have been considered monsters for as long as humanity can recall, and yet have always existed as an uncomfortable middle ground between the monsters and the civilized. They are monsters, yes, but they have more humanity, rationality, and culture than monsters tend to have. If they were interested, they very likely could have made places for themselves in the larger societies of the world, but they never have. Whether it be fear, hatred, or plain distaste, the Orcs have always been different and apart from the rest of the humanoid races of TWE.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Orcs are physically large, imposing, bestial creatures with skin that ranges from green to gray, scrunched features, and tusks that jut from their mouths. Their fashion often includes animal pelts and rags when they are raiding, but at home they use more stylized clothing. Their garments are always practical, but more subtle colors and fits are worn by those who earn the right to.

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> Orcish culture is severe and unforgiving. To live is to fight, struggling against nature and others to carve out a life for yourself among your tribe. Orcs respect other orcs, but that is because every living orc has fought hard and earned the right to be respected. They value art and music, though they would never admit that to outsiders. In order to leave no trace of their softer side, they sing only rarely and all of their art is made on temporary materials. 

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Functionality </b>
		<br> Orcs are strong, resilient creatures that fit well into the role of a martial warrior of some kind. However, they are not entirely cut off from magic. Orcs are known to dabble in wild and even divine magic as well as wield powerful bloodlines to augment their imposing physicality.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> These are the basic traits natural to Orc

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>
		<br> Orcs are large, strong, and inflexible in both body and mind.
		<br><br> +4 Dex, +2 Con, -2 Dex, -2 Int.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Base Speed </b>
		<br> Orcs have a base speed of 30 feet on land.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>
		<br> Orcs are Medium creatures and thus have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Orcs are Humanoids with the Orc subtype. They also count as monsters for the purposes of feats and abilities.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Defense Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br> <u>Superstitious:</u>  Orcs gain a +2 bonus on Will saves against spells. However, they also automatically attempt to resist any spell/caster combinations they have not encountered before and understood as positive.
		<br> <u>Orc Ferocity:</u> Orcs can remain standing after dropping below 0 HP for 1 turn with -1 action and then 1 more turn with -2 actions. They still bleed out as normal.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Skill Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br> <u>Intimidating Presence:</u>  Orcs gain a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Offense Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br> <u>Weapon Familiarity:</u> Orcs are proficient with greataxes and treat any weapon with the word "Orc" in its name as a martial weapon.
		<br><br> <u>Larger Than Life:</u> An Orc can wield a weapon sized for a creature one size category larger than them without suffering the penalty.
		<br><br> <u>Bite Attack:</u> Orcs gain a 1d3 bite attack that they can perform at a -5 penalty as an action. If they are grappling with an opponent, they can perform this attack as a swift action.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Racial Senses </b>
		<br><br> <u>Dark Vision:</u> Orcs can see 60 feet through darkness.
		<br><br> <u>Light Sensitivity:</u> Orcs are dazzled in direct sunlight, causing them to take a -1 penalty on attack rolls and perception checks.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Orcish Community </b>
		<br><br> <u>Respect:</u> Orcs respect other orcs. When they fight each other, they do not risk accidentally killing each other.
		<br><br> <u>Brotherhood:</u> When two or more orcs fight together, they become more confident. Gain a +2 bonus on any single roll made as a part of a conjoined turn if both participants have orcish blood.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Tribal Ancestry </b>
		<br> Orcs live all over TWE. While they are too resilient to evolve to match their surroundings, their sense of tribal belonging is so great that their cultures have shaped them.
			Choose <b>ONE</b> of the below abilities, based on what kind of tribe the orc hails from.

		<p class="body-text"><br><br> <u>Territorial:</u> These Orcs keep to themselves, staying inside borders they mark clearly. Anything foolish enough to enter their domain is struck down and eaten.
		<br> <ul>
			<li> When a creature passes over a boundary line into territory that they are currently guarding, they gain a +4 bonus on Initiative, attack, and damage rolls against that creature for the first 2 rounds of combat.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="body-text"><br><br> <u>Raiding:</u> These Orcs live nomadically, attacking existing settlements and taking what they want. They are accustomed to charging in and attacking savagely.
		<br> <ul>
			<li> They gain the Pounce trait, allowing them to attack with all of their natural attacks when they finish a charge.</li>
			<li> If they are charging with a weapon or an unarmed attack, they can make two attacks at the conclusion of their charge</li>
			<li> If these Orcs reduce a creature to 0 HP with a Charge, they can choose to knock the creature unconscious at 0 HP and grapple or loot them as a swift action.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="body-text"><br><br> <u>Aetherless:</u> These Orcs have been cut off from the aether through their own savage rituals. In return, they have been given an aetherless gift.
		<br> <ul>
			<li> They cannot cast arcane spells by any means.  </li>
			<li> They gain <b>ONE</b> of the below gifts:  
				<ol>
					<li> <b>Gift of the Bloodied One</b>: When dealing damage to a bleeding creature with a natural or unarmed attack, restore HP equal to the target's current bleed damage. </li>
					<li> <b>Gift of the Savage One</b>: Your bite attack becomes 1d8 and you no longer suffer a -5 penalty when you use it. If you gain an increase to your unarmed damage, increase the damage of your bite as well. If you gain a natural attack with higher base damage, increase the damage of your bite to match the new attack. </li>
					<li> <b>Gift of the Isolated One</b>: Your Superstitious bonus increases to +4. At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, increase the bonus by +2. In addition, gain SR 10 + your Con modifier. </li>
					<li> <b>Gift of the Mighty One</b>: While wielding a two-handed weapon, add twice your strength modifier to attack and damage instead of strength and a half. </li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ul>
