	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> The Abominations are the creations of the devious villain known as The Big Man, Olivia Bifelgos. Created by cruel and twisted experimentation using dark magics released into the world upon the dethroning of the goddess Hecate, the Abominations gained their disheartening name when they were unleashed upon the unsuspecting world on The Day the Earth Shook. They are born and bred killing machines created for the sole purpose of being living weapons. The people of Enthan, joined by the forces of the Kun'Achi tribe and the Darkers, managed to defeat the Big Man's army and scatter the Abominations across the countryside.
	<br><br> Now, with their brains newly freed from slavery to Olivia, the Abominations seek to find their way in a world hostile to their own existence. Many are experiencing free thought for the first time in their lives, coming to terms with re-emerging memories of past lives, struggling to handle rejection, and seeking to survive the armed warriors sent to hunt them down. It is a hard life the Abominations face, with more persecution awaiting them than any other race, but they have little choice. It is survival of the fittest, after all.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> The Abominations are an incredibly varied race. Their appearances vary greatly depending on which subtype of Abomination they are. There are links to sub-pages below to help you navigate the multiple subtypes.


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> The Abominations are the newest race to form, so their culture is limited, but they are strongly bound together by necessity. Regardless of what an Abomination looks like, they can expect better treatment from other Abominations than from anyone and anything else in TWE. They live and work closely together in hidden communes or on the run, always eager to protect their own.

		<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Abomination List </b>
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="abominations/AdaptedPage.html">Adapted</a> </b>
		<br> The least modified Abominations, hardly worthy of the title. These people are simply granted a few animalistic traits with little overall impact mechanically, physically, or socially.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="abominations/MutatedPage.html">Mutated</a> </b>
		<br> Mindless weapons of war suddenly given sentience and free-will. These 'monsters' are frightening to look upon and nearly impossible to pass as regular people. In exchange, they manifest the raw ferocity of the animal world far more clearly than Adapteds.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="abominations/PerfectedPage.html">Perfected</a> </b>
		<br> The final stage of Abomination in the eyes of the Big Man, these seemingly mundane beings pass as Adapted or even unmodified people entirely...until a secret phrase is uttered. 

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="abominations/MonstrousPage.html">Monstrous</a> </b>
		<br> Some more avid followers of Olivia used monsters instead of animals for their work. The results were far more limited in scope and far more unstable.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="">Conjoined</a> </b>
		<br> The darkest creation of all the Abominations. No animals were harmed in the making of the Conjoined, but many people were.
