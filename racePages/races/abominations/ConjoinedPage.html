	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> Conjoined Abominations are one of Olivia Bifelgos' darkest experiments. They were a brief thought, something she quickly dropped in favor of using monsters and animals, but her followers are not so quick to move on. Others picked up her research where she left off, seeking to create more fantastical and unstable creatures by merging multiple people into one body. Thgeir attempts were successful, darkly so. Now these people are left on their own in the aftermath of The Big Man's fall.
	<br><br> Now the Conjoined wander the world in search of a place where they are free from hunters, free to live lives of their own.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Conjoined Abominations vary wildly in how they may appear. They are all humanoid, sporting aspects of the appearances of one or both of the races they once were. Beyond that, however, it is difficult to describe them with general statements. Some may appear regular, albeit with some strange features befitting other races, but some may have entirely different


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> Conjoined Culture does not exist. There aren't enough of them to form a real culture, each Conjoined typically remaining solitary as they wrestle with what they have become and the many challenges that come with it.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Functionality </b>
		<br> Conjoined Abominations fill the same role as an Adapted or regular member of their race. The additional functionality provided by their monster aspect varies wildly, but always comes with a caveat. The monster does whatever it wants.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> The Racial Traits of a Conjoined are the same as their original race. The only differences are noted below.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Conjoined gain the Magical Beast and Monster subtypes in addition to their original typing.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>
		<br> Conjoined can range in size, but are typically Small or Medium, depending on the races that were joined together. The Rebus and Bisected Abominations can be Large creatures if both the creatures used to create them were Medium.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Conjoined Model </b>
		<br><br> Each Conjoined tends to fall into one of several archetypes known as Models. Most of their racial traits depend on which Model they are.
		<br><br> The Aspect itself grants a great power, but the options are too numerous and complex to be recorded here. Please work with your DM to decide on the perfect Conjoined Aspect for your character.
		<br><br> Here is a list of the currently known Models:
		<br><br> <b><u>Displaced:</u></b> One person has awoken in a body entirely foreign to them. Their mind is their own, but their body is that of another...one who can sometimes be seen in muscle memory, habits, and mannerisms.
		<br><br> <b><u>Bisected:</u></b> Two people share one body, each as a physical half of a whole. They are stitched together and they must figure out how to work together and, during battle, they must divvy their precious time between themselves.
		<br><br> <b><u>Packed:</u></b> Two or more people have been crammed into a single highly unstable form. This form can sometimes shift, allowing each person to have a unique form and powerset, but their internal chaos makes knowing who will be in control completely impossible. 
		<br><br> <b><u>The Rebus:</u></b> The unholy peak of alchemical achievement, the perfect union of male and female. The Rebus is made from the tragic intertwining of two people who loved each other dearly in life. Now, made into something entirely new, a combination of their physical and mental forms, the Rebus must find its own way in the world while struggling to manage the occasionally conflicting desires and opinions of its two imperfect halves.


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Displaced Features </b>
		<br><br> The Displaced are the least mechanically different from any other race. If you are playing a Displaced, create a character as normal but work with your GM to figure out who your body used to belong to and what body you used to have. There will likely be conflict between the two people, leading to complications in gameplay. 
		<br><br> This race is highly dependant on the player desiring to dig deep into roleplay. It offers no mechanical advantages or disadvantages outside of situational bonuses or penalties brought about by roleplay.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Bisected Features </b>
		<br><br> The Bisected is a very strange creature, a terrifying combination of two people. They are stitched together down the middle and, as a result of that, each of their powers and skills are accessible at any given time. This greatly increases their options, but also leaves them highly susceptible to damage.
		<br><br> <b><u>Left and Right:</u></b> During character creation, create two characters. Each can have their own race, class, and core ability scores. When allotting their ability scores, use 5 points less than normal for a character. Specify which character is the right half of the body and which is the left. Each character calculates level, hp, BAB, and every other stat entirely separately from the other. Each character is considered to have only one arm.
		<br><br> <b><u>Levelling up:</u></b> Each time the Bisected levels up, level up both Left and Right. Neither Left nor Right can multiclass due to the limited capacity of their half of the brain.
		<br><br> <b><u>Being Attacked:</u></b> When the Bisected is attacked with a melee attack, the attacker must choose to attack Left or Right and the attack is resolved as usual against that creature's defenses. If the attack is a Cleaving attack or any attack that can hit multiple targets, hitting Left or Right automatically strikes the other as well. Both Left and Right must make Fortitude and Will saves separately. Reflex saves, however, must be made by both sides or else both fail.
		<br><br> <b><u>Taking a Turn:</u></b> The Bisected, like anyone else, has 3 actions on their turn. These actions can be split between Left and Right as desired. 
		<br><br> <b><u>Dying:</u></b> If Left or Right fall unconscious, the remaining half is unable to move on their own. The Bisected falls prone, cannot move from its place and suffers -1 action per turn, but can still take whatever actions it can with its remaining faculties. It automatically fails any reflex saves. If one of the halves die, the other will fade away and die within 24 hours.


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Packed Features </b>
		<br><br> The Packed is a tortured being filled with yet more tortured beings. At least two beings are packed into one body, an enchanted form capable of taking on the appearance and abilities of any of those packed into it. This creature was intedned to be the strongest being, a truly unstoppable force of adaptability, but research ground to a halt when The Big Man was defeated. Now this unfinished creation must do what it can to belong in a world where none can truly understand the torrent of thoughts and emotions at war within it.
		<br><br> <b><u>Many:</u></b> During character creation, consult with your GM about how many characters are packed into your body. You must then create a character for each and every one of them, each complete with their own race, class, and ability scores. When allotting your scores, you have 5 points less than usual.
		<br><br> <b><u>Levelling up:</u></b> Each time the Packed levels up, level up each of the Many.
		<br><br> <b><u>Take a Number:</u></b> At character creation, assign a number (1-X) to each of the characters.
		<br><br> <b><u>Waking Up:</u></b> Every time the Packed wakes up from unconsciousness, roll a dice to decide which of the Many emerges. That character will be in control and cannot hand off control by choice.
		<br><br> <b><u>Taking Damage:</u></b> When the Packed takes damage (lethal or nonlethal), do not subtract it from the Packed's current HP. The Packed's body handles pain in a strange way due to its Many forms. Treat all damage taken like nonlethal damage and add it up, keeping track of all damage taken. When the amount of damage taken is equal to or greater than the Packed's maximum HP, then the Packed falls unconscious. It dies when the number of damage taken is equal to or greater than twice its max HP. 
		<br> When the Packed receives healing, decrease the number of damage taken instead of increasing HP. Due to its strange anatomy, nonlethal damage harms the Packed as much as lethal damage does. Damage Taken is added like nonlethal damage, but it can still kill the Packed and does not all vanish upon magical healing.
		<br> When the Packed is awoken from Unconscious by healing or stabilization, set the amount of damage taken equal to that form's maximum HP minus 1. 
		<br><br> <b><u>The Counsel of Many:</u></b> The Packed's physical form changes size and shape depending on which of the Many is in control. This includes garments and accessories, but not magical ones or weapons. Any weapons carried or magical items worn remain regardless of the form taken.
