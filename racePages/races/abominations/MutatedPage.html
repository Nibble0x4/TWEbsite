	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> Mutated Abominations are very new on the world scene. They were created in secret, a race of living weapons to be unleashed when Olivia Bifelgos was ready, and now they are a scattered and confused race. For most of them, they gained free will for the first time on the battlefield on The Day the Earth Shook. They were scattered on that day when their creator and controller was slain. 
	<br><br> Now the Mutated wander the world in search of a place where they are free from hunters, free to live lives of their own.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Mutated Abominations have been contorted and shaped for maximal physical effect. Little thought was given to appearance save that of frightening visage and fearful form. They exhibit strong aspects of both the person they once was and the animal forcibly merged with them, often in the most grotesque and terrifying combinations devisable.


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> Mutated Culture is close-knit and very, very young. The Mutateds are perhaps the most hunted and tormented of all the Abominations and, as a result, form the backbone of the fledgling groups that come together to try and survive the hunters. They are also among the most physically powerful, meaning they are an attractive friend and a daunting foe for any Abomination looking for a pack.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Functionality </b>
		<br> Mutated Abominations tend to fill a physical role of some type. They are physically strong, fast, and hardy and yet their minds are young and new. It is rare to find a Mutated Abomination renowned for anything but their ferocity. 

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> The Racial Traits of an Mutated are the same as their original race. The only differences are noted below.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Mutateds gain the Animal subtype in addition to their original typing.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>
		<br> Mutateds are, well, mutated versions of their original race. They gain a +2 to one of the physical score already boosted by their race and a +2 to a different physical score of their choice. (If no physical boost is given from their original race, then the +2 can be given to one of the boosted mental stats instead.) 
		<br><br> In addition, they gain a penalty of -4 to a mental score penalized by their race and a -4 to any mental score of their choice (If no mental penalty is given from their original race, then the -4 can be given to one of the penalized physical stats instead.)

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Animalistic Features </b>
		<br><br> Mutateds embody the physicality of both animal and man, boasting unmatched ferocity on the battlefield. They may select up to 4 abilities from the Universal <a href='https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/'>Monster Rules</a> page, making sure to select only those abilities that are affirmed by their GM and that make some sense for the animal they were crossed with.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Natural Weapon </b>
		<br><br> Mutateds possess natural weapons befitting their animal side. Pick 1 from the list below, according to your animal, and gain the corresponding weapon.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Critical Feature </b>
		<br><br> Depending on the style of attack primarily employed by the Mutated, they gain different effects when they successfully land a critical hit or a soft crit on a foe using their Mutated racial natural attack.
		<br><b> Below is a list of potential examples. Your choices are not limited to these, but all options should be discussed with your GM.

			<br><br> Double the Healing for that hit.
		<br><br> <u>Claws:</u>
			<br><br> Double the Bleed amount for that hit.

			<br><br> Roll twice and take the better result when making your Combat Maneuver.
		<br><br> <u>Talon:</u>
			<br><br> Roll twice and take the better result when making your Combat Maneuver.
		<br><br> <u>Kick:</u>
			<br><br> Double the distance you push on a successful kick. Any additional movement left when the target strikes an obstruction is handled using d8s instead of d6s.


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Weakness Features </b>
		<br><br> The Mutated Abominations gain many strengths, but there are unique weaknesses that come as a result of their unholy creation.
		<br><br> <u>Unsightly:</u>
			<br><br> Any creature that meets you starts your relationship as 1 step more hostile than normal. In addition, you suffer a -4 penalty on diplomacy and bluff checks but gain a +2 bonus on intimidate checks due to your untrustworthy appearance.
		<br><br> <u>Limited Education:</u>
			<br><br> You suffer a -2 penalty on all Knowledge and Linguistics skill checks due to being born very recently and without education.
		<br><br> <u>Aetherically Unsuited:</u>
			<br><br> Your body is ruined in the eyes of magic, forcing greater focus when you attempt to wield magic of any kind. Whenever you would use a spell or spell-like ability, you must roll a Concentration Check in order to avoid losing the spell or ability. If you fail, you lose that use and suffer 1d6 points of damage as the aether contorts your body in response.
