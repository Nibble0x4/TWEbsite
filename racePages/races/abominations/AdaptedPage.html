	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> Adapted Abominations are not as new to the world stage as their brethren. They, in fact, probably not even aware of their nature as Abominations. The Adapted were The Big Man's first wave of human experimentation. The unwanted and alone were taken in as children, experimented on until they received some small features from an animal, and then released back into the world. The hope was to pave the way for the ready acceptance of the Perfected, but The Day the Earth Shook came too quickly for her true plans to be revealed. 
	<br><br> The Adapted are, of course, unaware of the plan they were intended to help see through. Instead, they are simply people who have always had a feature or two that set them apart from their peers for one reason or another. Their history, they would say, is simply as people living slightly more secluded lives in the midst of the greater history of the races they were originally a part of.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Adapted Abominations have been spliced in some way with a single type of animal. Other than that, they maintain the appearance of whatever creature they were prior to being altered. A dwarf Adapted may have an extra pair of ears that resemble a cat and perhaps a tail with fur to match. Perhaps you find a halfling with whiskers and a rat-like nose. Perhaps that elf you met that one time has a bushy tail and an uncontrollable desire to bark at dogs. Adapted are mostly normal, but they have just enough animal in them to set them apart.


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> Adapted Culture is sparse and singular. Most Adapted have met only a handful of other Adapteds and, most likely, didn't see them as kin. As a result, their culture is virtually nonexistent outside of the races they live amongst.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Functionality </b>
		<br> Adapted Abominations fill the same functionality as their abse race, in most cases. They may have a slightly different ability set due to their animal influence, but the change is minor.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> The Racial Traits of an Adapted are the same as their original race. The only differences are noted below.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Adapteds gain the Animal subtype in addition to their original typing.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Animalistic Features </b>
		<br><br> Adapted always bear some sort of physical feature reminiscent of the animal they were spliced with. As a result, they gain an ability relevant to their feature or features. Someone with cat ears may have better hearing, those with dog tails may have better balance, and the eyes of an owl may grant some measure of night vision.
		<br><b> Below is a list of potential examples. Your choices are not limited to these, but all options should be discussed with your GM.
		<br><br> <u>Eyes:</u>
			<br><br><b>Keen Vision</b> A bonus to Sight-based Perception or some sort of vision ability such as darkvision
		<br><br> <u>Nose:</u>
			<br><br><b>Keen Scent</b> A bonus to scent-based Perception or the Scent ability
		<br><br> <u>Tail:</u>
			<br><br><b>Balance</b> A bonus to Acrobatics 
		<br><br> <u>Pawpads:</u>
			<br><br><b>Soft Steps</b> A bonus to Stealth
		<br><br> <u>Whiskers / Antennae:</u>
			<br><br><b>Close Detection</b> A short-range instinctual detection of creatures and threats.
