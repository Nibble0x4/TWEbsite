	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> Monstrous Abominations are very new on the world scene. They were created in secret, a race of living weapons to be unleashed when Olivia Bifelgos was ready, and now they are a scattered and confused race. For most of them, they gained free will for the first time on the battlefield on The Day the Earth Shook. They were scattered on that day when their creator and controller was slain. 
	<br><br> Now the Monstrous wander the world in search of a place where they are free from hunters, free to live lives of their own.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Monstrous Abominations mostly retain the appearance of their original race with an obvious exception. Some single part of their body has been replaced or augmented with a monster part from one of the deadly denizens of TWE. Perhaps their back and arms are weighed down with the metal feathers of a Gilgryph, maybe their hands have been replaced with the snapping crackling claws of the Pyrocancer, or perhaps their skin crawls with the fluidity of the Keeto. Whatever their change is, it simultaneously grants them great power and challenges their control of their own body.


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> Monstrous Culture is close-knit and very, very young. The Monstrous are wildcards, granted great strength at a great cost. A precious few manage to hide their monstrous nature for a time, but the secret inevitably makes itself known and the Monstrous is left with three options: Fight, Flight, or Death.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Functionality </b>
		<br> Monstrous Abominations fill the same role as an Adapted or regular member of their race. The additional functionality provided by their monster aspect varies wildly, but always comes with a caveat. The monster does whatever it wants.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> The Racial Traits of a Monstrous are the same as their original race. The only differences are noted below.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Monstrous gain the Magical Beast and Monster subtypes in addition to their original typing.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Monstrous Aspect </b>
		<br><br> Each Monstrous has a different aspect, depending on what is chosen by the player and the DM.
		<br><br> The Aspect itself grants a great power, but the options are too numerous and complex to be recorded here. Please work with your DM to decide on the perfect Monstrous Aspect for your character.
		<br><br> There are a number of constants, regardless of what you select as your Aspect:
		<br><br> <b><u>Will:</u></b> The Monster you have gained as a part of your body has a will of its own. What it desires must be set up by the DM, but it strongly desires to perform certain actions depending on the circumstance. If you wish to keep the monster from performing this action, you must defeat it with a battle of wills. Since the monster shares your will save, the result is a flat check of d20 vs d20.
		<br><br> <b><u>Pool:</u></b> Most Monsters will grant you highly powerful abilities if you can call upon in battle. You gain a small pool of points that may be spent to perform various abilities based upon your aspect. This pool contains a number of points equal to your Constitution Modifier plus 1/2 your character level and replenishes each morning after a full rest.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Weakness Features </b>
		<br><br> The Monstrous Abominations gain many strengths, but there are unique weaknesses that come as a result of their unholy creation.
		<br><br> <b><u>Unsightly:</u></b>
			<br><br> Any creature that meets you starts your relationship as 1 step more hostile than normal. In addition, you suffer a -4 penalty on diplomacy and bluff checks but gain a +2 bonus on intimidate checks due to your untrustworthy appearance.
		<br><br> <b><u>Limited Education:</u></b>
			<br><br> You suffer a -2 penalty on all Knowledge and Linguistics skill checks due to being born very recently and without education.
