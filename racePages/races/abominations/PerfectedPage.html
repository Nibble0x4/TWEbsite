	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> Perfected Abominations are very new on the world scene. They were created in secret, a race of living weapons to be unleashed when Olivia Bifelgos was ready, and now they are a scattered and confused race. For most of them, they gained free will for the first time on the battlefield on The Day the Earth Shook. They were scattered on that day when their creator and controller was slain. 
	<br><br> Now the Perfected wander the world in search of a place where they are free from hunters, free to live lives of their own.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Perfected Abominations have had their appearances painstakingly crafted to seem as inoffensive as possible. Some are made to appear completely mundane, as if no change was made whatsoever to their original race, but most appear as Adapted Abominations. Those that appear as Adapted Abominations appear as regular members of their race with the addition of one or two small animalistic features. 


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> Perfected Culture is one of fear and isolation. They are a secretive people, preferring it if nobody knows what they truly are. Those that can pass as regular people do so happily, but always with great fear lurking over their shoulders. They live each day in fear of someone uttering their secret phrase and transforming them, removing their humanity and their autonomy once more and reducing them to mere bestial servants. 
		<br><br> Because of this, most don't make any real connections with other Perfected Abominations. If, somehow, a Perfected chooses to share their secret phrase with another, it is considered the highest declaration of trust imaginable.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Functionality </b>
		<br> Perfected Abominations fill the same role as an Adapted or regular member of their race... until their phrase is uttered. Once they are transformed, they fill the role of a powerful and dangerous beast that may or may not be able to command their own actions.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> The Racial Traits of an Perfected are the same as their original race. The only differences are noted below.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Perfecteds gain the Animal and Magical Beast subtypes in addition to their original typing.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Animalistic Features (Adapted-Appearing Only)</b>
		<br><br> Perfecteds sometimes bear some sort of physical feature reminiscent of the animal they were spliced with. As a result, they gain an ability relevant to their feature or features. Someone with cat ears may have better hearing, those with dog tails may have better balance, and the eyes of an owl may grant some measure of night vision.
		<br><b> Below is a list of potential examples. Your choices are not limited to these, but all options should be discussed with your GM. </b>
		<br><br> <b><u>Eyes:</u></b>
			<br><br><b>Keen Vision</b> A bonus to Sight-based Perception or some sort of vision ability such as darkvision
		<br><br> <b><u>Nose:</u></b>
			<br><br><b>Keen Scent</b> A bonus to scent-based Perception or the Scent ability
		<br><br> <b><u>Tail:</u></b>
			<br><br><b>Balance</b> A bonus to Acrobatics 
		<br><br> <b><u>Pawpads:</u></b>
			<br><br><b>Soft Steps</b> A bonus to Stealth
		<br><br> <b><u>Whiskers / Antennae:</u></b>
			<br><br><b>Close Detection</b> A short-range instinctual detection of creatures and threats.

		

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Beast Form </b>
		<br><br> The one thing that sets Perfecteds apart is their alternate form, known as Beast Form, and the secret phrase that goes along with it. 
		<br><br> Each Perfected has a secret phrase (Chosen by the player, the DM, by randomness, or some mixture of these) that is necessary to trigger their Beast Form. When this phrase is uttered within regular hearing range of the Perfected, they are guaranteed to hear it despite any sort of interference. Even if they are deafened, asleep, or otherwise rendered unable to hear, the secret phrase finds its way to them so long as they are in regular earshot range.
		<br><br> When the Secret Phrase is used, the Perfected shifts into their Beast Form as an immediate action that does not provoke an Attack of Opportunity. They will remain in this form until they are killed, knocked unconscious, or until the Secret Phrase is spoken again by the same person who said it the first time. (The Perfected may trigger this transformation themselves. If they do, they need only think the phrase in order to shift back.)
		<br><br> While transformed, the Perfected is at the whim of the creature who transformed them. They must follow the creature's orders to the best of their ability and they are restricted from taking actions not included in their commands. They are restricted from harming the one who transformed them and remain under their control until they transform back or until the person who transformed them is dead.
		<br><br> Beast Form boasts many advantages over the base form. Each form is different, however, and many of the details of the form should be discussed with the DM. Here are a list of some of the basic changes that occur regardless of the unique form you create:
		<br><br> <b><u>Stats:</u></b> The Beast Forme gains a +6 bonus to Str, Dex, and Con.
		<br><br> <b><u>Toughness:</u></b> The Beast Forme gains a number of temporary HP equal to four times their level.  This HP is lost last and, after reverting to regular form, is subtratced from the current HP. This means that a creature who is knocked into this temporary HP will be unconscious but stable after reverting to regular form.
		<br><br> <b><u>Feeding Frenzy:</u></b> The Beast Forme heals 1 HP per level when it kills or consumes a dead creature. A creature that is Medium may be consumed twice, Large 3 times, Huge 4 times, etc.
		<br><br> <b><u>BAB:</u></b> The Beast Forme has a BAB equal to the character's level, regardless of their usual BAB.
		<br><br> <b><u>Speechless:</u></b> The Beast Forme cannot speak in any language but that of the creature they have become. This includes any mental conmmunication outside of an empathic link.
		<br><br> <b><u>Magical Lockdown:</u></b> The Beast Forme cannot use magic in any form, even if it would be able to use magic in animal form through some other ability.
		<br><br> <b><u>Eraced:</u></b> The Beast Forme loses any racial abilities or bonuses from their original race outside of their ability score modifiers.
