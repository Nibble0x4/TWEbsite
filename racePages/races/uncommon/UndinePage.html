	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> It isn't known how or when the monstrous water elementals gave rise to the Undine. They are here, that much is for certain, but their story is a difficult one to tell. The Undine have traced their origins back to almost every body of water one could find. Like their forefathers, the Undine come from and will one day return to the water. For now, though, the race is splintered into a countless number of nomadic tribes that roam the coasts, rivers, and lakes of TWE. They rarely settle down in one place for more than a year or two, building small structures beneath the surface of the water before packing it all up and moving on. They leave no trace of their presence behind, instead choosing to focus on finding new things. They have never been fans of recorded history, so oral history is the best records we have, unfortunately.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Undine bodies are humanoid in form and clearly solid to the touch, despite the more amorphous nature of the water elementals. Their skin tends toward the blues, greens, and browns of their watery homes. Their hair is thin and stringy, similar in consistency to seaweed, but becomes thick and full when plunged underwater. Their eyes range in color, but tend to complement their skin. Undine clothing is simple, functional, and sparse, allowing for freedom of movement in and out of water.


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> The Undine culture is difficult to pin down, considering how spread out their tribes are. There are, however, a few constants. Undine are calm and relaxed, often described as 'chill.' They are not loved on land where they are seen as monsters by much of the population, so they tend to remain on the move. They are placid on the outside, portraying a stoic picture of strength and versatility to outsiders. Among other Undine, however, they are an expressive and good-natured group. Particularly sneaky travelers may catch glimpses of their games and their dances, celebtrations of their heritage and the power of the element they are so in tune with. These displays are rare to witness, but are truly a heart-warming spectacle to behold. 

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Functionality </b>
		<br> Undine can fill most roles in a group apart from that of the brute force. They are swift and perceptive, able to adapt to most any situation, but they struggle when their only option is to hit something really hard. The power of the water is theirs, insofar as they can muster the strength to use it, allowing them some magical power despite their class.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> These are the basic traits natural to Undine

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>
		<br> Undine are both perceptive and agile, but tend to adapt rather than match force with force.
		<br><br> +2 Dex, +2 Wis, -2 Str


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Base Speed </b>
		<br> Undine have a base speed of 30 feet on land. They also have a swim speed of 30 feet, can move in water without making Swim checks, and always treat Swim as a class skill.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>
		<br> Undine are Medium creatures and thus have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Undine are outsiders with the native subtype.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Defense Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br> <u>Energy resistance:</u>  Undine halve all cold damage they take. In addition, they have cold resistance equal to their level.
		<br> <u>Energy Weakness:</u> Undine are weak their elemental opposite, fire. They gain Weakness to fire damage, taking double damage from it. Any effect that would give them resistance to fire is halved. Any effect that would make them immune to fire instead grants fire resistance 10 (After the half)

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Senses </b>
		<br><br> <u>Dark Vision:</u>  Undine can see perfectly in the dark up to 60 feet.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Elemental Abilities </b>
		<br> The Undine are closely affiliated with water, being descended from water elementals. As a result, they have the innate power to manipulate water by expending energy from within themselves. Undine have a Water Pool, a pool of points that regenerate after a full night's sleep and contain a maximum number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 their level. They can expend these points to cast from a list of spells at will. Each spell has a different cost associated with it, shown in parentheses.
		<br><br> <u>Spells:</u> 
		<br><br> Create Water (0)
		<br><br> Drench (0)

		<br><br> Water Walk (only on themselves) (1)
