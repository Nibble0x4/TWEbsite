	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> There is little to speak of the history of the Oreads. Their history is simple and reserved, content to sit on the outskirts and observe as the world busies itself with its own wars, histories, and goals. They have been here for as long as we can remember, with nobody being entirely sure when they first appeared, but they have never bothered to establish themselves as anything more than content people living in harmony with the land that bore them. It is in this way that they quietly move through history, always observing, often remembering, but rarely feeling the need to intervene.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Oreads are strong and solidly built, with skin and hair colored stony shades of black, brown, gray, or white. While all oreads appear vaguely earthy, a few bear more pronounced signs of their elemental heritage—skin that shines like polished onyx, rocky outcroppings protruding from their flesh, glowing gemstones for eyes, or hair like crystalline spikes. They often dress in earthy tones, wearing practical clothing well suited to vigorous physical activity and preferring fresh flowers, simple gemstones, and other natural accents to complex manufactured jewelry.

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> Oread culture is honestly not that different from human culture. Most Oreads appear to human families in the lands around great cities, a gift from the land to a kind, skilled, or faithful farmer who treats the land with care and respect. Far out from most other people, the Oreads live peaceful lives of simple acceptance and joy, taking pride in their honest labor and preferring to remain far away from the cities full of humans who would fear or revile them, comparing them to the destructive earth elementals. It is rare for an Oread to decide to rouse themselves from a peaceful life in pursuit of adventure. When they do venture out, it is often for a good reason and, when all is said and done, they are usually ready to settle back down into their routine and take pride in their completed work. When they are on the job, however, they are relentless in their efforts. They move slowly and steadily forward, flinching at nothing until their work is done and they can rest.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Functionality </b>
		<br> Oreads are strong and patient, well-suited to roles that require them to face danger head-on. They are not quick, so getting to the forefront can be difficult for them, but their patience and strength can be wielded potently from afar or up close. They function well as faithful clerics, strong warriors, and generally do well to leave the social heavy-lifting to others.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> These are the basic traits natural to Oreads

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>
		<br> Oreads are strong, solid, stable, and stoic
		<br><br> +2 Str, +2 Wis, -2 Cha


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Base Speed </b>
		<br> Oreads  have a base speed of 20 feet.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>
		<br> Oreads are Medium creatures and thus have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Oreads are outsiders with the native subtype.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Defense Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br> <u>Energy resistance:</u>  Oreads halve all acid damage they take. In addition, they have acid resistance equal to their level.
		<br> <u>Energy Weakness:</u> Oreads are weak their elemental opposite, electricity. They gain Weakness to electricity damage, taking double damage from it. Any effect that would give them resistance to electricity is halved. Any effect that would make them immune to electricity instead grants electricity resistance 10 (After the half)

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Senses </b>
		<br><br> <u>Dark Vision:</u> Oreads can see perfectly in the dark up to 60 feet

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Elemental Abilities </b>
		<br> The Oreads are closely affiliated with the earth, being descended from earth elementals. As a result, they have the innate power to manipulate earth by expending energy from within themselves. Oread have an Earth Pool, a pool of points that regenerate after a full night's sleep and contain a maximum number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 their level. They can expend these points to cast from a list of spells at will. Each spell has a different cost associated with it, shown in parentheses.
		<br><br> <u>Spells:</u> 
		<br><br> Acid Splash (0)
		<br><br> Sift (0)

		<br><br> Stone Throwing (1)

		<br><br> Stone Tell (2)

		<br><br> Meld into Stone (3)
		<br><br> Stoneskin (3)
		<br><br> Earth Glide (3)
		
		<br><br> <u>Earth Affinity:</u> Oread sorcerers with the elemental (earth) bloodline treat their Charisma score as 2 points higher for all sorcerer spells and class abilities. Oread clerics with the Earth domain cast their Acid domain powers and spells at +1 caster level.
