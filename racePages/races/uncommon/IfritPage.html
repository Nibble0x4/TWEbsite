	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> The Ifrit have a muddled history of assorted pride and shame. For many, their appearance is a sign of Vulcan's blessing and favor. As a result, it is not uncommon for citizens of Enthan to see the arrival of an Ifrit to be a sign of the merit of its parents. The parents, on the other hand, face the difficulty of raising a spirit of flame who is filled with the raging passion of their element and carries no regard whatsoever for social rules. The Wastes of Enthan have, in recent generations, become an excellent place for Ifrit who experience trouble fitting in at home. As a result, stories and legends abound of the great and daring exploits of the Ifrit tribes, scouring the desert sands in search of worthy prey to prove themselves against.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Ifrits vary in appearance as widely as their elemental ancestors do. Most have pointy ears, red or mottled horns on the brow, and hair that flickers and waves as if it were aflame. Some possess skin the color of polished brass or have charcoal-hued scales covering their arms and legs. Ifrits favor revealing and ostentatious clothing in bright oranges and reds, preferably paired with gaudy jewelry.

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> Ifrits are most often born into human communities. Ifrits are frightening and volatile, so those who grow up in a city are almost always imprisoned or driven off before they reach adulthood; most are simply too hot-headed and independent to fit into civilized society, and their predilection toward pyromania doesn’t endear them to the local authorities. Those born into nomadic or tribal societies fare much better, since ifrits’ instinctive urge to explore and conquer their surroundings can easily earn them a place among their tribe’s leadership. Most Ifrits are born in Enthan under the blessing of Vulcan. These Ifrit are often considered blessed or sacred, but that does little to assuage the fearful effect their appearance and actions have on most civilized folk. The Wastes, however, are incredibly appealing to them. There is little there that can restrict or control them and the unbearable daytime heat is invigorating to the Ifrit. Ifrit often find their ways to the Wastes and spend their lives traveling across the sands in search of excitement and a community who shares their passion.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Functionality </b>
		<br> Ifrit do not prefer to wait around. They enjoy acting, and they enjoy doing so in as flashy and bold a way as they can imagine. They rarely have the patience required for traditional divine or primal magics, but they are often seen dashing into battle or summoning hellfire to envelop their foes with a satisifed grin upon their faces.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> These are the basic traits natural to Ifrits

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>
		<br> Ifrits are passionate and quick, but impetuous and destructive.
		<br><br> +2 Dex, +2 Cha, -2 Wis


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Base Speed </b>
		<br> Ifrit have a base speed of 30 feet.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>
		<br> Ifrits are Medium creatures and thus have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Ifrits are outsiders with the native subtype.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Defense Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br> <u>Energy resistance:</u>  Ifrits halve all fire damage they take. In addition, they have fire resistance equal to their level.
		<br> <u>Energy Weakness:</u> Ifrits are weak their elemental opposite, cold. They gain Weakness to cold damage, taking double damage from it. Any effect that would give them resistance to cold is halved. Any effect that would make them immune to cold instead grants cold resistance 10 (After the half)

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Senses </b>
		<br><br> <u>Dark Vision:</u> Ifrits can see perfectly in the dark up to 60 feet

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Elemental Abilities </b>
		<br> The Ifrit are closely affiliated with fire, being descended from fire elementals. As a result, they have the innate power to manipulate fire by expending energy from within themselves. Ifrit have a Fire Pool, a pool of points that regenerate after a full night's sleep and contain a maximum number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 their level. They can expend these points to cast from a list of spells at will. Each spell has a different cost associated with it, shown in parentheses.
		<br><br> <u>Spells:</u> 
		<br><br> Spark (0)
		<br><br> Continual Flame (0)

		<br><br> Produce Flame (1)
		<br><br> Firebelly (1)
		<br><br> Burning Hands (1)

		<br><br> Flame Arrow (2)
		<br><br> Flame Blade (2) 
		<br><br> Stoke the Inner Fire (2)
		<br><br> Fiery Shuriken (2)

		<br><br> Campfire Wall (3)
		<br><br> Fire Trail (3)
		<br><br> Firestream (3)
		
		<br><br> <u>Fire Affinity:</u> Ifrit sorcerers with the elemental (fire) bloodline treat their Charisma score as 2 points higher for all sorcerer spells and class abilities. Ifrit clerics with the Fire domain cast their Fire domain powers and spells at +1 caster level.
