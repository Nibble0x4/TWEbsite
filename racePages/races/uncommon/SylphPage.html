	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> The Sylphs find their source in the blessings of the sky visited upon the faithful. Air elementals strike their targets hard and fast, shocking them with electricity and buffeting them with wind. It is not unheard of for survivors of air elemental attacks to go on to bear Sylph children, but the result was all too often the immediate murder of the child. Zeus, god of the sky, is the only consistent source for Sylphs who live to mature ages. He grants the blessing of Sylphhood to the children of mothers and fathers who have served him well and attained his favor. Once made, Sylphs can reproduce together to have significant odds of continuing the race, but the number of living Sylphs is still pitifully small compared to other races.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Sylphs are thin, dainty, and fair. Their skin tends to be light and almost translucent, marked all over the body with whirling and twisting pale-blue designs. Their hair tends to be vivid and their eyes bright. Small gusts of wind and errant breezes follow the Sylphs wherever they go, playing with their hair and traditionally loose garments. Other than these changes, it is not uncommon for Sylphs to resemble humans rather closely. It takes some effort, but many Sylphs choose to disguise themselves as humans to escape the wrath of other races who may have lost loved ones to air elemental attacks.

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> The Sylph culture is deeply intertwined with the shrine of Zeus and his followers. As denizens of the sky, they are considered protected and blessed by the lord of the sky. Most Sylphs are found in Shinta at the base of Mount Olympus or somewhere in the surrounding mountain ranges. Sylphs love mountains, high places where the winds blow strong and they feel closer than ever to the sky that is deeply a part of them. Sylphs in Shinta are respected and revered as signs of faith and kindness. they flourish there, allowing their emotions to rise and fall freely despite the small squalls or pleasant breezes that inevitably accompany such expressions. Sylph dancers and singers are the pride of their homes, spreading joy and wonder to all who stop to observe. Outside of Shinta, however, Sylphs are likely to cover their skin and regulate their emotions out of fear of being found out. Air elementals have killed many, and Sylphs are seen as monster progeny at best or deceiptive monsters at worst.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Functionality </b>
		<br> Sylphs are quick in mind and body, meaning they tend to excel as magic users or back-liners. Of course, that hardly stops them from specializing in careful up-front battles as swift combatants, but their natural frailty makes such endeavors particularly dangerous. They can wield the powers of the winds to assist their friends and propel themselves onward, but they always must beware the dangers of acid, their elemental opposite.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> These are the basic traits natural to Sylphs

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>
		<br> Sylphs are quick and insightful, but slight and delicate.
		<br><br> +2 Dex, +2 Int, -2 Con


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Base Speed </b>
		<br> Sylph have a base speed of 30 feet.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>
		<br> Sylphs are Medium creatures and thus have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Sylphs are outsiders with the native subtype.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Defense Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br> <u>Energy resistance:</u>  Sylphs halve all electric damage they take. In addition, they have electric resistance equal to their level.
		<br> <u>Energy Weakness:</u> Sylphs are weak to their elemental opposite, acid. They gain Weakness to acid damage, taking double damage from it. Any effect that would give them resistance to acid is halved. Any effect that would make them immune to acid instead grants acid resistance 10 (After the half)

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Senses </b>
		<br><br> <u>Low-Light Vision:</u>  Sylphs have low-light vision allowing them to see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Elemental Abilities </b>
		<br> The Sylph are closely affiliated with air, being descended from air elementals. As a result, they have the innate power to manipulate wind by expending energy from within themselves. Sylph have a Wind Pool, a pool of points that regenerate after a full night's sleep and contain a maximum number of points equal to 3 + 1/2 their level. They can expend these points to cast from a list of spells at will. Each spell has a different cost associated with it, shown in parentheses.
		<br><br> <u>Spells:</u> 
		<br><br> Breeze (0)
		<br><br> Jolt (0)

		<br><br> Feather Fall (only on themselves) (1)

		<br><br> Air Step (1)

		<br><br> Cloak of Winds (2)
		<br><br> Carrying Wind (2)
		<br><br> Feather Fall (group) (2)
		<br><br> Gust of Wind (2)

		<br><br> Windy Escape (3)
		<br><br> Air Geyser (3)
		<br><br> Reinvigorating Winds (3)
		
		<br><br> <u>Air Affinity:</u> Sylph sorcerers with the elemental (air) bloodline treat their Charisma score as 2 points higher for all sorcerer spells and class abilities. Sylph clerics with the Air domain cast their Air domain powers and spells at +1 caster level.
