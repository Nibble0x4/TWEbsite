	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> The Gillmen have a tragic and scarring history, one that truly shapes the current state of their people. Long ago, ancient humans were taken beneath the sea by the aboleths, a cruel and conniving deep-sea monster. The aboleths emit a film that, when absorbed through the skin, removed the humans' ability to breathe air and replaced it with the ability to breathe water. The humans were taken deep into the sea, down into the dark Depths where they served as thralls for generations. Only recently, in the last few years, did they manage to finally escape their bondage and leave the depths. Their fleshwarped bodies are now dependent on the water and, thanks to their titular gills, they can survive underwater without the aid of the aboleths. Now they exist in fractured tribes, each distrusting of every other living thing in TWE. They roam and they fight in search of answers they hope might one day reunite their people.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Gillmen are deep-sea beauties, fashioned and formed by the aboleth into shapes pleasing to the eyes and powerful to carry out their will. Their soft, delicate skin is light in color, ranging from pearl-white to peach to a sandy brown. Their hair is often dark brown or black, but for some it takes on the colors of the sea, and they have thick, expressive eyebrows.


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> Gillman culture is fraught with distrust and dissent. They form small tribes, only trusting their closest circles in a world they are convinced is out to get them. They only recently escaped the clutches of their cunning masters, and they don't even fully know how they were able to revolt. After all this time, they are lost in a world full of creatures that may or may not be serving the aboleths. They cannot be sure who is lying, who knows answers, and who to trust. Their people are spread apart, fearful that the other Gillman tribes may still be under the thrall of the aboleths or even that they themselves may be secretly serving their old masters. Such paranoia and fear keeps the Gillmen from uniting, so they travel the sea in search of answers. They are a warlike and aggressive race, always fighting as if their lives, or worse, their freedom, depended on it.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Functionality </b>
		<br> Gillmen are reviled by many as a rule of thumb, but they are often underestimated. All their years of struggles have made them strong. Their beauty is a weapon they wield well, and even the slimmest and most dainty-looking Gillman is still more durable and resilient than most other races. They make excellent up-front warriors and have a penchant for some magics that can be combined with their innate rage to create truly destructive melee warriors.

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> These are the basic traits natural to Gillmen

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>
		<br> Gillmen are vigorous and beautiful, but their domination by the aboleths has made them weak-willed.
		<br><br> +2 Con, +2 Cha, -2 Wis


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Base Speed </b>
		<br> Gillmen have different movement speeds in water and on land.
		<br><br> Gillmen have a base speed of 30 feet on land. As aquatic creatures, they also have a swim speed of 30 feet, can move in water without making Swim checks, and always treat Swim as a class skill.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>
		<br> Gillmen are Medium creatures and thus have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Gillmen are humanoids with the aquatic subtype.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Defense Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br> <u>Enchantment Resistance:</u>  Gillmen gain a +4 racial bonus to saving throws against non-aboleth enchantment spells and effects, but take a –4 penalty on such saving throws against aboleth sources.
		<br> <u>Defiance:</u> When Gillmen are targeted by and successfully resist an enchantment spell or effect, they rage in defiance and gain a +4 bonus to an ability score of their choice for 1 minute. If they are targeted by another such effect in this time and successfully resist it, they may gain the bonus again to a different score. A Gillman can only benefit from two of these bonuses at a time. Any further activations allow them to reset the duration and change one of the ability scores if they desire.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Offense Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br> <u>Subaquatic ferocity:</u>  Gillmen are accustomed to fighting for their lives underwater, and gain a +2 bonus to weapon damage rolls when fighting aquatic creatures.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Musical Abilities </b>
		<br><br><b><u>Song of the Sea:</u></b> When the Gillmen are deep in the sea, they can hear the whispers of the ocean, though the words are incomprehensible to them, they draw courage from it. They gain a +2 bonus on will saves when they are in the sea.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Other Racal Traits </b>
		<br><br><u>Amphibious:</u> Gillmen are amphibious, able to breathe both air and water.
		<br><br><u>Water Dependent:</u> A Gillman’s body requires constant submersion in fresh or salt water. Gillmen who spend more than one day without fully submerging themselves in water risk internal organ failure, painful cracking of the skin, and death within 4d6 hours.
