	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> The Merfolk have a rich and glorious history, full of mighty conflict and proud contests. They have always thought themselves to be the chosen of the sea, the strongest and most beautiful creatures to grace its depths. They are correct on several accounts. They are powerful, strong and swift, and undeniably alluring. They have long seen the sea as their birthright and have sought true foes to contest them for it. Sea monsters fall before their mighty hunting parties and other humanoid races simply cannot contend with their swift swimming and their strong attacks. It is only the rare exception who can truly compete with them. The Endura managed it once, legend says, but they have long since retreated to their Depths without the aid of their Duty Bond partners. Now, the Merfolk war with each other, forming kingdoms that fight each other for glory and honor. They defend the sea jealously from those who would take it from them, both for their own amusement and for the protection of the wildlife and the natural order.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Merfolk have the upper torsos of well-built and attractive humans and lower halves consisting of the tail and fins of a great fish. Their hair and scales span a wide range of hues, with Merfolk in a given region closely resembling each other. Merfolk can breathe air freely but move on dry land only with difficulty, and rarely spend long periods out of water. As a race, Merfolk are insular and distrustful of strangers, but individuals, especially adventuring Merfolk, break the mold and can be quite garrulous. Merfolk concern themselves more with nature and the arts than with morality and ethical debates, and have a strong inclination toward neutral alignments.

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> The Merfolk are a powerful and warlike race, revelling in the superiority they enjoy over all other races of the sea. They relish combat and the glory that can be won therein, as well as the satisfaction of seducing surfacers to their dooms in the briny depths. They are not evil, exactly. They would certainly describe themselves as majestic, but the rest of the sea is wary of their aggression. To those who befriend them, however, they are stalwart and upbeat allies who never back down from any challenge. The values of gallantry and honor are alive and well in Merfolk culture, encouraging self-sacrifice and courage. To those who can get past the dangerous exterior, Merfolk culture is filled with art and competition, the results of a people dedicated to self-improvement and greatness.
