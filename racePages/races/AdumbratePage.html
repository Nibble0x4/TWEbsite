	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> The Adumbrate have never left the clouds. They were born there, conceived as a people from the small floes that break off of larger clouds, and never once has it occurred to them to leave the safety of their sky home. The world below is…terrifying. It is hazy, flickering in form and changing with every moment it is observed. Monsters appear and raze the round world, inflicting death on creatures that seem to the Adumbrate to be far more capable than they themselves are.

	<br><br> Because of this, most Adumbrate try to live and ignore the surface world below them. They have their own issues, after all. Food must be acquired, homes must be built and rebuilt, and monsters must be thwarted. They have no time to worry about the world below.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> The Adumbrate are an airy race, with bodies seemingly made of cloud mixed with various elements of the world below. The exact appearance of any individual Adumbrate is largely up to the player’s imagination, but they tend to have long hair, sharp eyes, and bodies that look like thick fog coalesced into something firm. When they are small, they appear denser and their skin is as solid as any surface dweller. When they are large, their mass is separated and sparse, allowing them to nearly be seen through.
	<br><br> Each faction also has different effects on their appearance. The Boreal tend to have darker clouds and flakes of ice or snow mixed into their bodies. The Noti are known to steam and the Eurali swirl more than normal while the Zephyrous are often calmer and tend to contain less debris.
	<br><br> Despite their cloudy appearance, the skin of the Adumbrate is very physical and can be cut and damaged as normal. Instead of blood, the Adumbrate lose water and particles when they are bleeding.


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> The Adumbrate culture is a stratified one, largely due to the world in which they live. There are three layers to their world, the Floor, the Shroud, and the Whisps. Each of these layers are connected by great cloud structures, allowing for technical freedom of movement between layers, but the thick cloud makes travel between layers restricted to specific pathways and openings. 
		<br><br> At all times, the Adumbrate are at war. The different subraces are eternally fighting each other for supremacy and control over the winds. There are 4 Nexi on each layer, powerful locations filled with concentrated energy that the Adumbrate can harness and bend to their wills. In the immediate vicinity of a controlled Nexus, affiliated Adumbrate are more powerful and the edge of their control is marked by a break in the cloud layers. 
		<br><br> If all four Nexi of a given layer are controlled by 1 faction, then it results in a notable atmospheric event in TWE. If all 12 Nexi are ever controlled, it is said that the chaos of this realm would cease and that faction would have absolute power over the winds. 

		<br><br> On average, the Nexi live for the same duration as their human counterparts on the surface. However, the Nexi do not grow old and die the way humans do. Instead, they age at twice the rate (around 10 years old). When they have reached old age (around 40), they stop aging and begin to get younger. They will age in reverse until they become too small to continue and cease to exist (around 80).

		<br><br> Each of the factions have their own culture as well.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="adumbrate/BorealPage.html">Boreal</a> </b>
		<br> The least modified Abominations, hardly worthy of the title. These people are simply granted a few animalistic traits with little overall impact mechanically, physically, or socially.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="adumbrate/ZephyrousPage.html">Zephyrous</a> </b>
		<br> Mindless weapons of war suddenly given sentience and free-will. These 'monsters' are frightening to look upon and nearly impossible to pass as regular people. In exchange, they manifest the raw ferocity of the animal world far more clearly than Adapteds.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="adumbrate/EuraliPage.html">Eurali</a> </b>
		<br> The final stage of Abomination in the eyes of the Big Man, these seemingly mundane beings pass as Adapted or even unmodified people entirely...until a secret phrase is uttered. 

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="adumbrate/NotiPage.html">Noti</a> </b>
		<br> Some more avid followers of Olivia used monsters instead of animals for their work. The results were far more limited in scope and far more unstable.
