	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> The Zae have a complicated history, one that their minds have lost the ability to fully contain. As a result of their small size and somewhat limited memory capacity, they have taken to writing down whatever they DO remember. Their oldest texts date back hundreds of years, and tell a tale of duty and abandonment, loyalty and neglect, the evolution of a people and the birth of a species. 
	Over time, the Zae began to do what every creature must do in the Archae, evolve. They sought to leave nearly no imprint on the land, and as a result their steps grew lighter and lighter. Their bodies became smaller, requiring less food and leaving smaller footprints. With their bodies shrinking, they needed ways to move to escape predators. They climbed the trees in the Verdant region and lived there, leaping from tree branch to tree branch as their progressively smaller bodies required less and less aid to remain above the ground. Soon, they evolved wings to help them in their motions. To this day, the bodies of the Zae remain as they became, tiny unassuming humanoids with wings upon their backs. They cannot soar, but the wings allow them to glide and ride the gusts of wind that are common in the Archae. 
	To this day, the Zae protect the sanctity of the Archae. They do their best to live in harmony with the land, and have even split up into sects that take up residence in each of the Archae’s Regions, with the exception of the Purple Region that proved too dangerous to live in.



	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> The Zae are a tiny race, averaging a foot tall with the tallest males reaching 1.5 feet and the shortest females coming in at 8 to 10 inches tall. Their features are human, but their eyes and ears are large to maximize their sensory perception. They dress themselves simply and practically, leaving ample room for whatever kind of movement is most suitable to their environment. Their eyes are vibrantly colored, ranging in hues from all over the spectrum. They are equipped with a set of wings that grow during puberty, and vary in design based on their region. Their arms and legs are not dainty and useless, as they have not had the chance to rely on flight. 


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> The Zae culture is a simple one. They look over the Archae and keep its wild nature pure. They live in such a way as to keep themselves secret as well, living in the environment in such a way as to be entirely invisible to a casual viewer. They inscribe their writing all over the place, leaving notes and even full on books all over their environment simply by scratching into surfaces. To an inexperienced eye, these notes look like simple scratch marks or natural weather marks, but the Zae know better.
	When it comes to outsiders, the Zae are not openly hostile. Humans may come and see, they may fight and survive, but any attempt to master the realm or establish permanent settlement is meant with decisive action. The Zae do not give warning, as they know the nature of the human heart is to covet and overcome all opposition. Instead, they simply offer peace and friendship along with their advice. If their advice is not heeded, then the perpetrators have brought their judgment upon themselves.
	The Zae are a very small race, and they run through their lives quickly, but have little regard for time. They reach maturity quickly, finishing puberty by the age of 10, but they cease aging after that. An 11 year old Zae is fully mature, but will look the same as a 100 year old Zae in a perfect world. The air of the Archae sustains them. However, the Zae have grown so in tune with the Archae that they have even solved the problem of overpopulation. There are ___ Zae in each region, and that number will never change for long. Zae cannot get pregnant unless there is a Zae soul waiting for rebirth. Whenever a Zae dies, their soul is returned to a female from their region and grown into a brand new body. This is a form of reincarnation, but their memories are wiped and their forms are entirely new. In this way, the population of Zae remains constant. 
	Despite their potential for limitless age, the majority of Zae fall prey to the creatures of the Archae by the age of 40, with precious few living beyond 50. Any Zae living longer than 50 years is considered an elder, and are referred to reverentially as Zaedra. The Zaedra are repositories of wisdom, using their life experience to nurture and guide the young, but their lives are also the first to be put in harm’s way. If a Zaedra hides in an attempt to prolong their own life, they are seen as selfish and are in danger of being thrown to the beasts to give new life a chance.
