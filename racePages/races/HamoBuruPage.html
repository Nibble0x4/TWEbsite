	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> The Hamoburu people have always lived in Areth. They are the unsung workers of the Chosen Race, with little natural aptitude for wielding the Flux, Hamoburu Fluxcasters are few and far between, rarely becoming well known for their exploits.


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> The Hamoburu are physically identical to normal Arethians in almost every way. The only defining trait about them is their ever so slightly calming presence. For some reason, a Hamoburu that is at war carries with him or her a sense of peace, a sense that things will be alright.


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> From day to day, these people work the thankless jobs that support their society. They are traders, caravan drivers, farmers, and construction workers. With little in the way of ambition or mental acuity, they are often content to do the simple labor. They are quite good at this, but some wish to help in more substantive ways by aiding the military. Even as skilled soldiers they are constantly overshadowed by the awesome power of their Flux-wielding brothers and sisters. However, the Hamoburu take quiet contentment in knowing that when there is danger, the renowned fluxcasters have a reliable force behind them, ready to protect and to aid.


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> These are the basic traits natural to Hamoburu.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>
		<br> The Hamoburu are accustomed to heavy physical labor, but are not naturally gifted with the flux. They gain:
     	<br>+1 str, +1 dex, +1 con, -1 int, -1 wis, -1 cha, and a +1 modifier to any physical score they choose.


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Base Speed </b>
		<br> A Hamo-Buru's base speed is 30 feet.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>
		<br> The Hamo-Buru are medium creatures and thus gain no penalties or bonuses from their size.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Hamo-Buru are humans for all affects that pertain to typing.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Skill Traits </b>
		<br><u>Trustworthy:</u> The Hamoburu have a calming presence that stems from their dependable nature. They can choose to use their con modifier on diplomacy rolls that are not intended to harm or swindle their target.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Magic Traits </b>
		<br><u>Flux Resistance:</u> The Hamoburu are of the Chosen Race, and have become accustomed to the rampant flux use around them. They gain DR equal to their level against Flux attacks, and gain a +2 bonus on saves against Flux effects.
		<br><u>Flux Inaptitude:</u> A Hamoburu fluxcaster is a rare sight. If one does appear,  they are not particularly noteworthy. For every 2 levels they gain in fluxcaster, they gain 1 less attack/defense dice than a standard flux caster.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Bonus Feat </b>
		<br> Hamo-Buru gain a single bonus feat at 1st level.
