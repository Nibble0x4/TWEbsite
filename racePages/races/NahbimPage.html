	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> The Raphim are an intellectual race that have lived in the Heavens since time immemorial. They have built a society in the Cumulant layer, hunting and gathering in the Strattal layer for substantial needs while entertaining themselves on an intellectual level by engaging with the more complicated mechanics of their world. Glimpses of these beings are thought to be the primary idea behind 'angels', and though there is no known contact between the people of TWE and the Raphim, this is not due to any natural distaste or hatred. Rather, the Raphim have been entirely content to live and work in peace in the Heavens whilst the War of the Winds whistled about their ears.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Raphia men and women are built both powerfully and beautifully, their forms often considered to be the standard for humanoids. They move smoothly, powerfully, and their features are pleasant. Their expressions are often placid, almost stoic, but that is not because of any secrecy or emotionless tendencies. Rather, it is because they are unaccustomed to using their faces to express their emotions. Each Raphim bears a Halo of light over their head, an intangible light construct that changes shape and color fluidly to depict their mood. Curiosity, anger, surprise, love, every emotion that humans can convey in their faces is shown plainly atop the heads of the Raphim. It is also common for depictions of 'angels' to include great white wings. The Raphim do possess the ability to manifest cloudy white wings at will, but they find them somewhat bulky for everyday use and have learned to banish them when they are not needed.

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> These are the basic traits natural to Raphim

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>

		<br><br> They also have wings, giving them a 30 feet fly speed with perfect maneuverability. They cannot fly if they are overburdened.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>

		<br><br> <u>Electric Resistance:</u>  Nahbim gain a resistance to electricity equal to their character level.
		<br> <u>Energy Generation:</u> The Nahbim can spend 1 action to infuse an item she is holding with electricity. If this is a weapon, it will deal an additional 1d4 electric damage on its next successful hit against a non-Adumbrate creature. The electric damage increases at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 6d4 damage at 20th level. She may also choose to infuse her feather coat with this energy, applying it to all of her feathers for 1d4 rounds.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Other Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br><u>Feather Down:</u> The Nahbim are resilient against cold and heat, using their downy coats. They gain resistance to both Cold and Fire equal to their character level.
		<br><br><u>Feather Fling:</u> The feathers of the Nahbim are small and sharp, well-balanced for throwing. She can pluck and throw a feather as a thrown weapon with 10 foot range as an action. The feather is treated as a dart sized for the Nahbim.
