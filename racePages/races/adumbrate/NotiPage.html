	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> The Noti are born of the warm southern wind, children of the wind goddess Notus. They appear at her will, as manifestations of her hot and unrelenting nature.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Each faction has different effects on their appearance. The Boreal tend to have darker clouds and flakes of ice or snow mixed into their bodies. The Noti are known to steam and the Eurali swirl more than normal while the Zephyrous are often calmer and tend to contain less debris.


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> A slow-moving but fiercely determined people driven by powerful emotions and deep passions. They take longer to collect themselves and move on Nexi, but tend to do so in powerful fronts that often end up taking multiple Nexi at once. They are difficult to stop once they begin moving, overwhelming nearly any defense, but their captured Nexi are often slow to respond to attacks and can be overwhelmed themselves if they are struck quickly enough.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Functionality </b>
		<br> Noti Adumbrates are strong and forceful, pushing their way inexorably through any defense. Their passionate and powerful nature makes them an excellent choice for those roles such as bloodrager and paladin that require force in personality and arm alike.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> The Racial Traits of a Noti are noted below

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Noti gain the elemental and humanoid subtypes.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>
		<br> The Noti are slow to react, but are overwhelmingly powerful. <b>+2 Strength, +2 Charisma, -3 Dexterity</b>.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Base Speed </b>
		<br>  The Noti have a base movement speed of 20 feet, with a float speed of 20 feet.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>
		<br> Adumbrate are, by nature, Medium creatures and thus have no bonuses or penalties due to size.
		<br><br>	However, Adumbrate are capable of expanding or condensing their bodies. When they do so, they can either become:
		<br><br>	<b>Small</b>, gaining a +1 size bonus on AC and attack rolls and gaining a +4 size bonus to stealth checks but suffering a -1 size penalty on CMB and CMD, along with a -4 penalty to Intimidate checks.
		<br><br>	Or <b>Large</b>, gaining a +1 size bonus on CMB and CMD and gaining a +4 size bonus to Intimidate checks but suffering a -1 size penalty on AC and attack rolls, along with a -4 penalty to Stealth checks.
		<br><br>	Regardless of their size, <b>Adumbrate use the damage dice for a medium creature</b>.


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Nexus Features </b>
		<br><br> Nexus - Each faction of Adumbrate has a different effect generated by a Nexus aligned with them. If a Nexus is aligned with them, they gain the Bonus. If a Nexus is aligned against them, they suffer the Penalty. If the Adumbrate is somehow under the effects of multiple different Nexi, the effects of different-aligned Nexi stack. The effects of multiple same-aligned Nexi do not stack.
		<br><br> <u>Nexus Effects:</u>
			<br><br><b>Bonus: </b> +2 Strength and +2 Charisma. Increase the Caster Level and DC of any spells or effects with the [Fire] descriptor by 1d4 upon casting. Add 1d4 fire damage to any attacks.
			<br><br><b>Penalty: </b> -2 Dexterity. Halve all cold damage dealt. Take 1.5x damage from fire.
		<br><br> <u>Special Ability:</u>
			<br><br><b>Inner Nexus: </b>  A Notus can spend 2 actions to create a small Nexus inside her body. This Nexus does not extend its effects outside of her body and lasts for a number of rounds equal to her charisma modifier.


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Magical Abilities </b>
		<br><br> <u>Change Density - </u> The Adumbrate can spend 3 actions to alter the density of her body, expanding or condensing herself to change her size. Doing so does not change her weight or her core ability scores in any way. In addition to the changes mentioned in the Size section above, the Adumbrate gains the following when she changes size:
		<br>Small- 	A +2 bonus to AC, Fortitude Saves, and Reflex Saves. -10 ft movement speed and cannot Float.
		<br>Large- 	A -2 penalty to AC, Fortitude Saves, and Reflex Saves. 10 foot reach.
		<br><br> <u>Float Speed - </u> Every Adumbrate has a Float speed. This functions identically to a fly speed, but with the following differences:
		<br> - She is considered flat-footed against attacks.
		<br> - While floating, she must roll twice and take the lower result on Reflex and Fortitude saves. 
		<br> - If she is struck by wind or a physical effect that might move her, she must succeed at a fortitude save (DC = 10 + damage taken or = the DC of the effect) or be pushed 10 feet plus 5 feet per 5 by which she fails the DC at the whim of her attacker. 
		<br> - She cannot support the weight of any other Small or larger creature. She must make a Fly check in order to carry anything of significant weight.
		<br><br> <u>Air Affiliated - </u> As an air-affiliated creature, the Adumbrate gain a +1 bonus to Caster Level and DC of any spells with the [Air] or [Electricity] descriptors.
		<br><br> <u>Energy Generation - </u> The Adumbrate can spend 1 action to infuse an item they are holding with electricity. If this is a weapon, it will deal an additional 1d4 electric damage on its next successful hit against a non-Adumbrate creature. The electric damage increases at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 6d4 damage at 20th level.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Skill Traits  </b>
		<br><br> <u>Floating Around - </u> Adumbrate gain a +4 racial bonus on Fly checks.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Sense Traits  </b>
		<br><br> <u>Low-Light Vision - </u> Adumbrate can see twice as far as humans in low-light conditions. 

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Defense Traits  </b>
		<br><br> <u>Lightning Immunity - </u> Adumbrate take no damage from electricity. Instead, they store all electric damage done. This damage resets after 12 hours.
		<br><br> <u>Nimbus - </u> When an Adumbrate has stored at least a number of electric damage equal to their level, they can spend that much of it as a swift action to gain 1 extra action that round. 

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Weakness Traits  </b>
		<br><br> <u>Acid Weakness - </u> Adumbrate are air-affiliated creatures and thus take double damage from acid. In addition, when rolling a save against a spell with the [Earth] or [Acid] descriptors, they must roll twice and take the worst result. They cannot cast a spell with either of these descriptors.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Languages  </b>
		<br><br> The Adumbrate begin play speaking Primordial. If they have a high intelligence score, they can choose to speak Common.
