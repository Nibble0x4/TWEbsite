	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> The Eurali are born of the chaotic eastern wind, children of the wind god Euralus. They appear at his will, as manifestations of his restless nature.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Each faction has different effects on their appearance. The Boreal tend to have darker clouds and flakes of ice or snow mixed into their bodies. The Noti are known to steam and the Eurali swirl more than normal while the Zephyrous are often calmer and tend to contain less debris.


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> A violent and fast-paced people, always rushing from one point to another. They employ quick and sporadic attacks with little to no rhyme or reason. They are chaotic and potent, striking hard and fast with surprise attacks and ambush tactics, but they lack the defensive prowess and patience required to hold the Nexi for long.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Functionality </b>
		<br> Eurali Adumbrates are quick and powerful, striking well-defended foes and outmaneuvering their opponenents. They make for excellent rogues, but function well as any warlike role.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> The Racial Traits of a Euralus are noted below

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Euralis gain the elemental and humanoid subtypes.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>
		<br> The Eurali are quick and devastating, but lack patience. <b>+2 Dexterity, +2 Strength, -3 Wisdom</b>.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Base Speed </b>
		<br>  The Eurali have a base movement speed of 40 feet, with a float speed of 40 feet.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>
		<br> Adumbrate are, by nature, Medium creatures and thus have no bonuses or penalties due to size.
		<br><br>	However, Adumbrate are capable of expanding or condensing their bodies. When they do so, they can either become:
		<br><br>	<b>Small</b>, gaining a +1 size bonus on AC and attack rolls and gaining a +4 size bonus to stealth checks but suffering a -1 size penalty on CMB and CMD, along with a -4 penalty to Intimidate checks.
		<br><br>	Or <b>Large</b>, gaining a +1 size bonus on CMB and CMD and gaining a +4 size bonus to Intimidate checks but suffering a -1 size penalty on AC and attack rolls, along with a -4 penalty to Stealth checks.
		<br><br>	Regardless of their size, <b>Adumbrate use the damage dice for a medium creature</b>.


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Nexus Features </b>
		<br><br> Nexus - Each faction of Adumbrate has a different effect generated by a Nexus aligned with them. If a Nexus is aligned with them, they gain the Bonus. If a Nexus is aligned against them, they suffer the Penalty. If the Adumbrate is somehow under the effects of multiple different Nexi, the effects of different-aligned Nexi stack. The effects of multiple same-aligned Nexi do not stack.
		<br><br> <u>Nexus Effects:</u>
			<br><br><b>Bonus: </b> +2 Dexterity and +2 Strength. As a swift action, empower one attack roll this turn to either become a touch attack or treat the target as flat-footed. Add 1d6 physical damage to all attacks.
			<br><br><b>Penalty: </b>  -2 Constitution. -1 AC. Any concealment you gain or miss chances against you is ignored by attackers. 
		<br><br> <u>Special Ability:</u>
			<br><br><b>Defiant Nexus: </b>  A Euralus can, as an action, negate any penalties she is suffering from a specific Nexus for a number of rounds equal to a mental modifier of her choice (The choice is made at first level and cannot be changed)


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Magical Abilities </b>
		<br><br> <u>Change Density - </u> The Adumbrate can spend 3 actions to alter the density of her body, expanding or condensing herself to change her size. Doing so does not change her weight or her core ability scores in any way. In addition to the changes mentioned in the Size section above, the Adumbrate gains the following when she changes size:
		<br>Small- 	A +2 bonus to AC, Fortitude Saves, and Reflex Saves. -10 ft movement speed and cannot Float.
		<br>Large- 	A -2 penalty to AC, Fortitude Saves, and Reflex Saves. 10 foot reach.
		<br><br> <u>Float Speed - </u> Every Adumbrate has a Float speed. This functions identically to a fly speed, but with the following differences:
		<br> - She is considered flat-footed against attacks.
		<br> - While floating, she must roll twice and take the lower result on Reflex and Fortitude saves. 
		<br> - If she is struck by wind or a physical effect that might move her, she must succeed at a fortitude save (DC = 10 + damage taken or = the DC of the effect) or be pushed 10 feet plus 5 feet per 5 by which she fails the DC at the whim of her attacker. 
		<br> - She cannot support the weight of any other Small or larger creature. She must make a Fly check in order to carry anything of significant weight.
		<br><br> <u>Air Affiliated - </u> As an air-affiliated creature, the Adumbrate gain a +1 bonus to Caster Level and DC of any spells with the [Air] or [Electricity] descriptors.
		<br><br> <u>Energy Generation - </u> The Adumbrate can spend 1 action to infuse an item they are holding with electricity. If this is a weapon, it will deal an additional 1d4 electric damage on its next successful hit against a non-Adumbrate creature. The electric damage increases at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 6d4 damage at 20th level.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Skill Traits  </b>
		<br><br> <u>Floating Around - </u> Adumbrate gain a +4 racial bonus on Fly checks.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Sense Traits  </b>
		<br><br> <u>Low-Light Vision - </u> Adumbrate can see twice as far as humans in low-light conditions. 

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Defense Traits  </b>
		<br><br> <u>Lightning Immunity - </u> Adumbrate take no damage from electricity. Instead, they store all electric damage done. This damage resets after 12 hours.
		<br><br> <u>Nimbus - </u> When an Adumbrate has stored at least a number of electric damage equal to their level, they can spend that much of it as a swift action to gain 1 extra action that round. 

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Weakness Traits  </b>
		<br><br> <u>Acid Weakness - </u> Adumbrate are air-affiliated creatures and thus take double damage from acid. In addition, when rolling a save against a spell with the [Earth] or [Acid] descriptors, they must roll twice and take the worst result. They cannot cast a spell with either of these descriptors.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Languages  </b>
		<br><br> The Adumbrate begin play speaking Primordial. If they have a high intelligence score, they can choose to speak Common.
