	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> The Boreal are born of the cold northern wind, children of the wind god Boreus. They appear at his will, as manifestations of his driving desire to rule.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Each faction has different effects on their appearance. The Boreal tend to have darker clouds and flakes of ice or snow mixed into their bodies. The Noti are known to steam and the Eurali swirl more than normal while the Zephyrous are often calmer and tend to contain less debris.


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> A cold and efficient people, driven by strategy and careful precision. They respond and act quickly, gathering powerful fronts, but their advances are slow and easy to react to as they need to decrease the temperature of the region in order to become powerful enough to take a Nexus. Taking a frozen Boreal Nexus, however, is a rather difficult task for most factions.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Functionality </b>
		<br> Boreal Adumbrates are hardy and relentless, excelling in both magic and resisting attacks. This lends them toward potent front-line casters such as magi or wizards who aren't afraid to mix it up in melee.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> The Racial Traits of a Boreal are noted below

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Boreals gain the elemental and humanoid subtypes.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>
		<br> The Boreal are resilient and clever, but are cold and poor at developing relationships. <b> +2 Intelligence, +2 Constitution, -3 Charisma.</b>

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Base Speed </b>
		<br>  The Boreal have a base movement speed of 30 feet with a floating speed of 10 feet.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>
		<br> Adumbrate are, by nature, Medium creatures and thus have no bonuses or penalties due to size.
		<br><br>	However, Adumbrate are capable of expanding or condensing their bodies. When they do so, they can either become:
		<br><br>	<b>Small</b>, gaining a +1 size bonus on AC and attack rolls and gaining a +4 size bonus to stealth checks but suffering a -1 size penalty on CMB and CMD, along with a -4 penalty to Intimidate checks.
		<br><br>	Or <b>Large</b>, gaining a +1 size bonus on CMB and CMD and gaining a +4 size bonus to Intimidate checks but suffering a -1 size penalty on AC and attack rolls, along with a -4 penalty to Stealth checks.
		<br><br>	Regardless of their size, <b>Adumbrate use the damage dice for a medium creature</b>.


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Nexus Features </b>
		<br><br> Nexus - Each faction of Adumbrate has a different effect generated by a Nexus aligned with them. If a Nexus is aligned with them, they gain the Bonus. If a Nexus is aligned against them, they suffer the Penalty. If the Adumbrate is somehow under the effects of multiple different Nexi, the effects of different-aligned Nexi stack. The effects of multiple same-aligned Nexi do not stack.
		<br><br> <u>Nexus Effects:</u>
			<br><br><b>Bonus: </b> +2 Constitution and +2 Strength. Increase the Caster Level and DC of any spells or effects with the [Cold] descriptor by 1d4 upon casting. Add 1d4 cold damage to any attacks.
			<br><br><b>Penalty: </b> -2 Dexterity. Halve all fire damage dealt. Take 1.5x damage from cold.
		<br><br> <u>Special Ability:</u>
			<br><br><b>Outer Nexus: </b>  A Boreal can spend 2 actions to create a small Nexus in a space adjacent to her. When she does, the Nexus extends its effects in a 30 ft radius. She can only maintain 1 Nexus at a time in this way and it only lasts for a number of rounds equal to her Intelligence modifier. The Nexus cannot be converted to another faction, but it can be destroyed. It has AC 10, hardness equal to her level, and HP equal to twice its hardness. It is weak to fire damage.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Magical Abilities </b>
		<br><br> <u>Change Density - </u> The Adumbrate can spend 3 actions to alter the density of her body, expanding or condensing herself to change her size. Doing so does not change her weight or her core ability scores in any way. In addition to the changes mentioned in the Size section above, the Adumbrate gains the following when she changes size:
		<br>Small- 	A +2 bonus to AC, Fortitude Saves, and Reflex Saves. -10 ft movement speed and cannot Float.
		<br>Large- 	A -2 penalty to AC, Fortitude Saves, and Reflex Saves. 10 foot reach.
		<br><br> <u>Float Speed - </u> Every Adumbrate has a Float speed. This functions identically to a fly speed, but with the following differences:
		<br> - She is considered flat-footed against attacks.
		<br> - While floating, she must roll twice and take the lower result on Reflex and Fortitude saves. 
		<br> - If she is struck by wind or a physical effect that might move her, she must succeed at a fortitude save (DC = 10 + damage taken or = the DC of the effect) or be pushed 10 feet plus 5 feet per 5 by which she fails the DC at the whim of her attacker. 
		<br> - She cannot support the weight of any other Small or larger creature. She must make a Fly check in order to carry anything of significant weight.
		<br><br> <u>Air Affiliated - </u> As an air-affiliated creature, the Adumbrate gain a +1 bonus to Caster Level and DC of any spells with the [Air] or [Electricity] descriptors.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Skill Traits  </b>
		<br><br> <u>Floating Around - </u> Adumbrate gain a +4 racial bonus on Fly checks.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Sense Traits  </b>
		<br><br> <u>Low-Light Vision - </u> Adumbrate can see twice as far as humans in low-light conditions. 

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Defense Traits  </b>
		<br><br> <u>Lightning Immunity - </u> Adumbrate take no damage from electricity. Instead, they store all electric damage done. This damage resets after 12 hours.
		<br><br> <u>Nimbus - </u> When an Adumbrate has stored at least a number of electric damage equal to their level, they can spend that much of it as a swift action to gain 1 extra action that round. 

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Weakness Traits  </b>
		<br><br> <u>Acid Weakness - </u> Adumbrate are air-affiliated creatures and thus take double damage from acid. In addition, when rolling a save against a spell with the [Earth] or [Acid] descriptors, they must roll twice and take the worst result. They cannot cast a spell with either of these descriptors.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Languages  </b>
		<br><br> The Adumbrate begin play speaking Primordial. If they have a high intelligence score, they can choose to speak Common.
