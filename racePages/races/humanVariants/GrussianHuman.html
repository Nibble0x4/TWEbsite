	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Grussian Humans </b>
	<br>The frozen wastlelands of the wild North are hospitable to none. While great and thriving empires have risen and fallen in warmer climates, there are people who have remained in a simpler life. This land is known as Gruss, and its people are simultaneously feared and looked down upon by the more civilized peoples of TWE. 
	<br><br> The Grussians all live a hard life in the harsh and unforgiving tundra and frozen forests of the North, but they do not all live the SAME hard lives. There are 4 tribes, and getting them mixed up is a quick way to die. Grussians from different tribes are almost always fighting amongst themselves in some way, but the only thing they can all agree on is their love for their way of life and their hatred for anyone who would try to take their lands from them. 
	<br><br> Novali, the westernmost tribe, is the most civilized of the tribes. They are the only ones who trade with other provinces, and have even built permanent settlements in recent years. The Pettan tribe is the most religious, if you could call their beliefs religion. They are highly superstitious, and they often venture deep into the Wilds on their nomadic travels. The sacred sites of Cold and Death are tended to by the Pettan, and any who would approach them must do so with extreme caution. The Khazi are the wildest of the Grussians, eschewing even the Common language in their desire for a pure existence. They hunt, they fight, they eat, they travel, and they do so in the most dangerous places they can find. Crossing the Khazi is a sure recipe for a quick end. Finally, the easternmost tribe of Habor is engaged in the longest recorded war in TWE. They fight against the Arethians in a constant bloodfeud. They revere War and wage it nearly as a ssort of artform. 
	<br><br>Each variant human has a set of Born Traits and a set of Raised Traits. It is up to the player which, if any, they choose to adopt. A human may be born in one place and raised in another, depending on their backstory and the GM's allowance.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Novali: </b>
		<br> The Novali have paved the way for the rest of Gruss, taking the first steps toward civilization. Whether this is seen as progress or weakness depends on your viewpoint, but it definitely has its perks. Notably, being able to construct hasty fortifications that can improve your odds against giant monsters.
		<br><br> <u>Emergency Construction-</u> When crafting, you have a critical range of 19-20. In addition, natural 1s do not result in a wasted hour. Any items you create have +50% durability and +1 hardness.


		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Pettan: </b>
		<br> The Wilds of Gruss are filled with dangerous monsters. However, encountering a Pettan patrol might be even more damning. Once their gaze settles upon you, you know instinctively that your end approaches. 
		<br><br> <u>Cold, Dead Eyes-</u> A number of times per day equal to your wisdom modifier, you may spend an action to make a Gaze attack at a creature you can see. The creature doesn't have to be able to see you. The target must make a Will save DC of 10 + 1/2 X + your wis modifier or else gain Vulnerability X to a damage type of your choice until the start of your next turn. X is equal to your level.


		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Khazi: </b>
		<br> The Khazi people seek a life of purity, oneness with the wilder world. When they are raised in this manner, they learn from the beasts and monsters around them and manifest a special ability.
		<br><br> <u>Aspect of the Wild-</u> You may select 1 of the universal monster rules below, gaining its effects for yourself.
		<br> - All-Around Vision (Can see in all directions at once. Cannot be flanked)
		<br> - Bleed (An attack or spell can inflict bleed 2 on a hit or on a failed save. This does stack. Can be used a number of times per day equal to your str modifier)
		<br> - Grab (On an unarmed strike, once per turn, attempt a free Grapple check if against a creature of qual or lesser size)
		<br> - Fortification (50% chance to negate critical hits or sneak attack damage)
		<br> - Freeze (When remaining completely still, it can attempt a stealth check with a +20 modifier to hide in plain sight as an inaimate object)
		<br> - Frightful Presence (When using an action that affects at least 1 creature, add a Will Save DC 10 + 1/2 level + cha. Failure given Shaken 2. Use thi a number of times per day equal to your Cha modifier)
		<br> - Greensight (See through thick plant matter up to 60 feet. It offers no concealment to your enemies)
		<br> - Scent (Can detect (not locate) creatures within 30 feet. Can track creatures with Survival with +2 by smell)
		<br> - Lifesense (Can locate creatures within 15 feet as if by blindsight)
		<br> - Darkvision (60 feet)
		<br> - Mental Static Aura (All creatures within 30 feet must make concentration save DC 10 + 1/2 level + cha modifier to cast a spell)
		<br> - Natural Attacks (Gain a Bite(1d6) or 2xClaws(1d4) attacks)
		<br> - Pounce (When you Charge, you may use a Full-Attack action on contact)
		<br> - Powerful Charge (When you charge, deal 1d6 extra damage)
		<br> - Rend (When two melee attacks of yours hit, you may deal additional damage equal to 1.5x your str modifier)
		<br> - Sound Mimicry (Can use Bluff to try to imitate creature sounds)
		<br> - Strangle (Grappled creatures cannot speak)
		<br> - Trample (When you overrun a smaller creature, deal 1d8 damage)


		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Habor: </b>
		<br> The Habor have been at war for generations. They hold the line, keeping the Arethians at bay and protecting the sanctity of the Grussian wilderness. To them, holding fast is all that matters. They dedicate their lives to ensuring that none get past, not even one. 
		<br><br> <u>War's Own Blood Line-</u> You may spend an action to deal 1 point of damage to yourself. If you do, you may select a number of squares within 20 feet up to your constitution modifier. These squares must be adjacent to at least 1 other selected square. These squares now contain a Blood Line. Any creature who steps across this line provokes an attack of opportunity from you, provided you can reach them with a melee weapon. If you have no attacks of opportunity remaining, you may still make the attack at a -4 penalty.
