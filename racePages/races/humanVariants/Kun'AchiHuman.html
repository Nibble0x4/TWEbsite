	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Kun'Achi Humans </b>
	<br>Chet'Tun is an island in the inner sea of That Which Exists. Though, in recent decades, it has taken on the title of THE Island. Chet'Tun has a bloody history. Starting in the aftermath of the Calamity that rocked all of That Which Exists, the Island was ravaged by vicious civil war for 100 years. Only in late Spring of 4459 did the bloody war come to an end. Now, the island that was once split by two tribes furiously fighting to kill each other has been reunited once more. The <b>Harachi</b> and the <b>Kun'Haman</b> tribes have become one tribe once again, as it was before, uniting under their original name: The <b>Kun'Achi</b>.
	<br><br> The <b>Kun'Hamans</b> in the eastern portion of the island make up the majority of the population. They fought the Harachi for generations to defend the seat of power of their god, Ocean. The <b>Harachi</b>, on the other hand, have finally succeeded after all this time at dethroning the god who allowed such a Calamity to come about. The Harachi were nearly decimated in the war, having only a few small families remaining, but they have taken their place alongside their estranged Kun'Haman brothers and sisters to form the Kun'Achi tribe and remind the world why they call themselves the masters of the sea.
	<br><br>Each variant human has a set of Born Traits and a set of Raised Traits. It is up to the player which, if any, they choose to adopt. A human may be born in one place and raised in another, depending on their backstory and the GM's allowance.

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Born Traits </b>
	<br> These are the traits you gain for being born on Chet'Tun.
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Ability Score Improvements </b>
		<br> The people of the island are swift and careful. Being embroiled in war for so long has enabled them to think and act more precisely than the rest of the world. They gain a <b>+1 racial bonus</b> to <b>dexterity</b>, <b>wisdom</b>, and a <b>+1 racial bonus</b> to a score of their <b>choice</b>.
		<br> This replaces the core human ability score modifications.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Masters of the Sea </b>
		<br> The Islanders of Chet'Tun are renowned the world over as Masters of the Sea. Their sailing prowess is unparalleled, and some say the sea is in their very bones.
		<br> Add Profession(Sailor) as a class skill. In addition, gain Skill Focus(Profession: Sailor) as a bonus feat. At level 1, place a free bonus skill rank into the Profession(Sailor) skill. 
		<br> When making any sort of d20 roll at sea, whether it be an attack roll for a cannon shot, and acrobatics check to swing on the rigging, A Profession(Sailor) check to read the winds, or even just an attack roll to cut down the pirate boarding your vessel, add a +2 racial bonus to the roll. This replaces the Skilled trait.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Raised Traits </b>
	<br> These are the traits you gain for being raised on Chet'Tun. You gain different trait options based on whether you are traditionally Harachi or Kun'Haman. You may select 1 of trait options listed.
	<br> Whichever trait you pick, it replaces the core human Bonus Feat trait.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Harachi: </b>
		<br> The Harachi did battle as quick, powerful, stealthy killers. Assassins were their primary method of offense, rendering the dense jungles of western Chet'Tun a dangerous place for foes. Seers guided them, looking down from their high places to spy out targets through meditative trances. 
		<br><br> <u>Spiritualism of the Seer-</u> You may, as a 10 minute ritual, once per day, use <a href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/scrying/">Scrying</a> to attempt to find a creature you have met. You must climb to a high point to do this, and can only see creatures with this ritual if they are at a lower elevation than you. You may only scry on a creature, not an object. If you do not know the target, only knowing OF them, they gain a +5 bonus to their save against the spell. 
		<br><br> <u>Strike of the Assassin-</u> If you are unobserved by a creature that you can see well, then you may choose to study them as 1 action. If you study them in this way for 3 turns, then they are considered your Mark. You may only have 1 Mark at a time. You lose your Mark if you cannot see them for 3 rounds. The first time you make an attack against your Mark, choose one: 
		<br> - Your attack is a guaranteed hit. Do not roll attack.
		<br> - Your attack, if it hits, is a critical hit. If the attack roll is a critical anyway, increase the critical multiplier by 1.
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Kun'Haman: </b>
		<br> The Kun'Haman tribe is methodical and precise, unrelenting and disciplined in the pursuit of their goal. The tribe's army stood upon two pillars. The military encouraged and trained their soldiers, from the greatest to the smallest, in the ways of tactics. The constantly shifting strategies of the traditional military and its leaders was complemented perfectly by the ardent dedication of the religious acolytes of the god Ocean. Those who revered Ocean held to strong dogmas, refusing to change amidst pressures and earning great success by weathering storms of uncertainty that would have shaken lesser men and women. 
		<br><br> <u>Fervor of the Acolyte- </u> Whenever you attempt an action again, immediately after attempting it, you gain a bonus to that action. If the action is a skill check that you just attempted, add +2 to the check. If the action is an attack roll with the same weapon against the same creature as before, add +2 to the attack roll. If the action is casting a spell you just cast, add +2 to the DC or Caster Level of the spell, your choice. 
		<br><br> <u>Tactician's Inspiration- </u> Each morning, you may select a single Teamwork Feat that you meet the prerequisites for. You may gain the benefits of that feat until the next time you use Tactician's Inspiration again. In addition, when you select the feat, you may choose a number of friendly present creatures up to your intelligence modifier (If your charisma or Wisdom modifiers are higher, you may use one of them instead) to also gain benefits as if they had the feat. The other creatures need not meet the prerequisites, if you already meet them.
