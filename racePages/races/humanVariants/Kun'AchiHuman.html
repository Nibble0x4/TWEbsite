	<p class="text"> <b class="subheader"> Kun'Achi Humans </b>
	<br>Chet'Tun is an island in the inner sea of That Which Exists. Though, in recent decades, it has taken on the title of THE Island. Chet'Tun has a bloody history. Starting in the aftermath of the Calamity that rocked all of That Which Exists, the Island was ravaged by vicious civil war for 100 years. Only in late Spring of 4459 did the bloody war come to an end. Now, the island that was once split by two tribes furiously fighting to kill each other has been reunited once more. The <b>Harachi</b> and the <b>Kun'Haman</b> tribes have become one tribe once again, as it was before, uniting under their original name: The <b>Kun'Achi</b>.
	<br><br> The <b>Kun'Hamans</b> in the eastern portion of the island make up the majority of the population. They fought the Harachi for generations to defend the seat of power of their god, Ocean. The <b>Harachi</b>, on the other hand, have finally succeeded after all this time at dethroning the god who allowed such a Calamity to come about. The Harachi were nearly decimated in the war, having only a few small families remaining, but they have taken their place alongside their estranged Kun'Haman brothers and sisters to form the Kun'Achi tribe and remind the world why they call themselves the masters of the sea.
	<br><br>Each variant human has a set of Born Traits and a set of Raised Traits. It is up to the player which, if any, they choose to adopt. A human may be born in one place and raised in another, depending on their backstory and the GM's allowance.
	 
	
	<hr>
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Born Traits </b>
	<br> These are the traits you gain for being born on Chet'Tun. You gain different traits based on whether you are traditionally Harachi or Kun'Haman.
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Ability Score Improvements </b>
		<br> The Tarian people are quick to adapt and learn. Though they have very different ideas of what is most worth learning and adapting to, they share in a sort of quickness that the rest of the world struggles to overcome. They gain a <b>+1 racial bonus</b> to <b>dexterity</b>, <b>wisdom</b>, and a <b>+1 racial bonus</b> to a score of their <b>choice</b>.
		<br> This replaces the core human ability score modifications.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Harachi: </b>
		<br> The Harachi did battle as quick, powerful, stealthy killers. Assassins were their primary method of offense, rendering the dense jungles of western Chet'Tun a dangerous place for foes. Seers guided them, looking down from their high places to spy out targets through meditative trances. 
		<br><br> <u>Spiritualism of the Seer-</u> You may, as a 
		<br><br> <u>Strike of the Assassin-</u> Select 3 Knowledge skills. If you are not trained in them, then become trained in them. If you are already trained in them, then gain the skill focus feat for those skills.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Raised Traits </b>
	<br> These are the traits you gain for being raised in Taria. You can choose to be raised in any of the city-states, but you must take the corresponding two traits for the one you select.
	<br> Whichever trait set you pick, it replaces the core human Bonus Feat trait and Skilled trait.
		


		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Motham: </b>
		<br> The smallest and most obscure city-state is hidden in the mountains north of Camus. Motham is home to the seat of power of the goddess of magic, Hecate. Here, magic seems to almost flow through the air and inundates all those who dwell here. Unlike the conventional casting of Camus, the residents of Motham prefer to feel the magic more organically. It is not uncommon for more unconventional and even taboo magics to be practiced freely here. Physical arms and armor, on the other hand, are seen as distateful and even taboo themselves.
		<br><br> <u>Magical Implementation-</u> You may use a magical item such as a wand, staff, or rod as a weapon, dealing damage and gaining bonus effects as suitable for the item. 
		<br><br> <u>Magical Device Use-</u> You are trained in Use Magic Device. If you are already trained in it, then you gain the Skill Focus(Use Magic Device) feat. You may attempt Use Magic Device to use any such item, regardless of your magical affinity, with a 25% chance to avoid expending its charge/energy (if applicable).

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shinta: </b>
		<br> Shinta is a small and quaint town nestled at the base of Mount Olympus, the seat of Zeus, the god of the heavens. Shinta is a peaceful town that knows no violence, instead residing under the gentle protection of their god and his powerful protectors. The people here rely on Zeus' benevolence for their food and thrive, so they seek to show similar hospitality to any and all who appear at their doors. Being able to give a good gift is among the most enviable skills in Shinta.
		<br><br> <u>Cheerful Giver-</u> When you give an item to a creature who you think would particularly like it, you may roll either a diplomacy, sense motive, or Handle Animal, depending on the situation (hostile people need diplomacy, other people need sense motive, and animals need handle animal). Doing so may cause the creature to shift its relationship to you. A neutral creature becomes friendly and trusting, an already friendly creature feels a strong desire to repay you, and a hostile creature may lose their hostility to you or even your allies.
		<br><br> <u>Generous Intuition-</u> Select 2 of the following skills: Diplomacy, Sense Motive, and Handle Animal. You are now trained in those skills. If you are already trained in those skills, you instead gain the Skill Focus feat for them. In addition, you may use one of those 3 skills, as appropriate, to try and dig deeper into a creature's heart to see what things it might like.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Bismuth: </b>
		<br> Port Bismuth is a large, bustling, eternally moving center of culture and commerce. The citizens of Bismuth are trained from an early age to spot a deal and a deceiver a mile away. Learning to navigate a conversation is even more important than navigating a ship or city here, where money reigns and fortune smiles on the bold. In the richest city in That Which Exists, a quick with is more deadly than a quick blade.
		<br><br> <u>Economical Insight-</u> You may attempt an Appraise check to perceive a limited version of the history of a coin or other piece of currency you can examine. This functions much like the Blood Biography spell, but on currency, allowing you to view what sort of purposes it has been used for.
		<br><br> <u>Socially Adept-</u> Select 3 from the following list of skills: Appraise, Diplomacy, Bluff, Sleight of Hand, Craft. If you are not trained in them, then become trained in them. If you are already trained in them, then gain the spell focus feat for those skills.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Morta: </b>
		<br> Morta is the northern village of the Tri-Villages. It is devoted to the art of the polearm, featuring the home of a unique fighting style feared the world over. The mercenaries trained here, known as Spearmasters, take pride in their strength and constantly challenge each other to battle. While not every citizen becomes a Spearmaster, every one is taught the basics.
		<br><br> <u>Polearm training-</u> Select a simple or martial polearm. If you are not proficient with it, then you become proficient. If you are proficient already, then you gain the weapon focus feat for that weapon. While you are wielding this weapon, you gain a +1 shield bonus to your ac. 
		<br><br> <u>Opportunistic Flurry-</u> If a creature performs multiple actions that provoke attacks of opportunity, or if they move in a way that might provoke more than one attack of opportunity, you may take those opportunities, only spending one attack of opportunity total to do so.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Carta: </b>
		<br> Carta is the eastern village of the Tri-Villages. It is devoted to the art of the bow, featuring the home of a unique fighting style feared the world over. The mercenaries trained here, known as Bowmasters, take pride in their precision and constantly challenge each other to battle. While not every citizen becomes a Bowmaster, every one is taught the basics.
		<br><br> <u>Ranged weapon training-</u> Select a bow, crossbow, or thrown weapon of some kind. Become proficient in the use of that weapon. If you are already proficient, then gain the weapon focus feat for that weapon. While you are wielding this weapon, increase the critical threat range by 1 (this is calculated AFTER doubling effects such as keen).
		<br><br> <u>Opportunistic Intervention-</u> If a ranged attack passes through your space or any space you threaten, then you may spend an attack of opportunity to negate that attack, as per the Deflect Arrows feat. 

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Werta: </b>
		<br> Werta is the western village of the Tri-Villages. It is devoted to the use of a specific magical art known as mana, featuring the home of a unique fighting style feared the world over. The mercenaries trained here, known as Manabound, take pride in their discipline and constantly challenge each other to battle. While not every citizen becomes a Manabound, every one is taught the basics of unarmed combat.
		<br><br> <u>Unarmed Training-</u> You gain the Improved Unarmed Fighting feat. If you already have this feat, then increase the critical multiplier of your unarmed attacks by 1.
		<br><br> <u>Opportunistic Versatility-</u> When making an attack of opportunity, you may choose to use a combat maneuver instead of an attack roll.
