	<p class="class-description"> <b class="subheader"> Arethian Humans </b>
	<br>Areth, the eastern empire of TWE, has long existed as a hostile and sequestered province. To the rest of the world, they are known as an egocentric, cutthroat, elitist society that jealously guards its borders and seeks to expand them at the slightest sign of weakness. However, Areth possesses a rich culture and history, once you get past their borders. They do not trade with the rest of the provinces, but inside of their own lands you will find a thriving economy that facilitates trade throughout all of their beautiful lands. They do not possess the varied climates of Enthan or the independant parts of Areth or Gruss, but their region is green, vibrant, and intensely magical. To the north lies an expansive forest filled with fae of all kinds, and to the south lies the Dark Wood, a dangerous thick forest and the home of many hags, witches, and other monstrous horrors. The people born and raised here feel as if they live in a separate world, a kind of idealistic land that fosters and cares for its own. Among all of this stands the Emperor, the ruler and protector of Areth, the blessed one, the incarnation of Xihe. The Emperor's power is absolute, and the flow of life centers on their capitol city of Yanor in the Lake. There is a massive difference between life in Yanor and the other big cities, and then life in the smaller towns of the empire. These differences manifest in the people who live there.
	<br><br>Each variant human has a set of Born Traits and a set of Raised Traits. It is up to the player which, if any, they choose to adopt. A human may be born in one place and raised in another, depending on their backstory and the GM's allowance.
