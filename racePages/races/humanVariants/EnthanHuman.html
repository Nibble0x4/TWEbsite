	<p class="text"> <b class="subheader"> Enthan Humans </b>
	<br>Enthan is a land of imperial might and carefully enforced order. The western empire has the most diverse biome collection of any province in That Which Exists, boasting frigid mountain peaks, warm forests, sunny shores, and, of course, the Great Plains of Enthan upon which sits their mighty capitol city. Each city or town of Enthan is trained in the imperial style of combat, meaning humans from each town have very similar culture and styles, but they still have adapted differences based upon the climate they lived in.
	<br><br>Each variant human has a set of Born Traits and a set of Raised Traits. It is up to the player which, if any, they choose to adopt. A human may be born in one place and raised in another, depending on their backstory and the GM's allowance.
	 
	
	<hr>
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Born Traits </b>
	<br> These are the traits you gain for being born in Enthan.
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Ability Score Improvements </b>
		<br> The Enthan people are unmoving. They are resilient and relentless, capable of holding their borders through a mixture of physical sturdiness, diplomatic action, and a strong bond of camaraderie. They gain a +1 racial bonus to constitution, charisma, and a +1 racial bonus to a score of their choice.
		<br> This replaces the core human ability score modifications.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Armaments of the Empire </b>
		<br> The Enthan empire is widely renowned for their mastery of the longsword, as well as their skills with bulky armor and heavy shields. They gain the following feature:
		<br><br> <u>Imperial Arms-</u> You gain proficiency with the longsword, heavy armor, and shields. If you gain proficiency in longswords from your class, then you instead gain the Weapon Focus(longsword) feat. If you gain proficiency in heavy armor from your class, then you instead gain a +1 bonus to ac whenever you wear heavy armor. If you gain proficiency in shields from your class, then you instead have a choice: You can gain proficiency in tower shields, or you can gain a +1 bonus to ac whenever you wear or wield a shield.
		<br> This replaces the core human Bonus Feat trait.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Raised Traits </b>
	<br> These are the traits you gain for being raised in Enthan. You can pick one of the following, either a single Imperial Combat Skill or a single Regional Trait. Whether or not your character has a military background is likely to play a role here. 
	<br> Whichever trait you pick, it replaces the core human Skilled trait.
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Imperial Combat Skills: </b>
		<br> The Enthan Imperial knights and guards are all trained in a standardized style. From this style, recruits tend to master one of the following 4 skills. These are accessible regardless of where in the empire you were raised.
		<br><br> <u>With Me!-</u> When initiative is rolled, you may choose to call out to your allies. Any allies who wish may move their initiative directly before or after yours, as you allow.
		<br><br> <u>Behind Me!-</u> You may spend an action to shelter an ally near you, putting yourself at risk to protect them. If your ac is greater than theirs, you may choose to grant your ac to them and take a -2 penalty to your own until the start of your next turn, if they remain within reach.
		<br><br> <u>To Me!-</u> If you spend an action to defend, the defense bonus to ac you gain is increased by 1 for every adjacent allied creature that is also using a defend action. Half of this bonus is also granted to adjacent defending creatures. 
		<br><br> <u>Face Me!-</u>  If an ally is attacked by a creature within reach, you may spend an attack of opportunity to make an attack roll against them with a +2 bonus to attack and damage. 

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Regional Traits: </b>
		<br><br> Enthan citizens raised in different climates of the varied empire tend to exhibit different advantages over each other as a result of growing up or spending significant time in a region. These traits are accessible only if your backstory fits properly.
		<br><br> <u>Planar Confidence-</u> Your ground movement speed, regardless of armor, is increased by 5 feet. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on saves against anything that you can see, though you take a -2 penalty on saves against things you cannot. 
		<br>City Homes that qualify: Great Enthan, Thyllia
		<br><br> <u>Shoreline Vigor-</u> You are trained in Swim. If you already have this as a class skill, you instead gain the skill focus(swim) feat.  You also gain the Improved Initiative feat. You can rise to your feet without spending an action, so long as you are able to do so.
		<br>City Homes that qualify: Port Thargas, Port Eyre, Endan Village
		<br><br> <u>Desert Resilience-</u> Gain the Endurance feat. When an effect says you would be fatigued, do not become fatigued. Only when an effect says you are exhausted do you become fatigued. You cannot be exhausted.
		<br>City Homes that qualify: The Wastes
		<br><br> <u>Forest Herbalism-</u> You are trained in survival and perception. If you already have these as class skills, you instead gain the skill focus feats for them. You can climb tree-like structures without needing a climb check and can take 10 on disguise checks using foliage or similar materials.
		<br>City Homes that qualify: Endan Village, Port Thargas
		<br><br> <u>Mountainous Traversal-</u> You are trained in Acrobatics and Climb. If you already have these as class skills, you instead gain the skill focus feats for them. You can take 10 on climb checks to climb rocky surfaces and on acrobatics checks to reduce fall damage.
		<br>City Homes that qualify: Thyllia, Dace
