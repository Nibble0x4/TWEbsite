	<p class="text"> <b class="subheader"> Tarian Humans </b>
	<br>Taria is the southern province of That Which Exists. It is made up of several factions or city-states that work together to create the Tarian Alliance. Each city-state differs vastly from the next and, despite their occasional disagreements and infighting, are united by their common desire to reject the rule of the two empires that sit at their borders. With Enthan to the West and Areth to the East, Tarians live in constant awareness that they could be invaded by power-hungry monarchs. Unlike those empires, though, their strength lies not in their uniformity but in their stark differences. 
	<br><br> <b>Camus</b>, <b>Motham</b>, <b>Bismuth</b>, <b>Shinta</b>, and the <b>Tri-villages of Morta, Carta</b>, and <b>Werta</b>. These are the different city-states of the Tarian Alliance. They live very different lives and build different cultures. Because of this, there is only a single shared Born Trait for Tarians. The only trait these different variant humans share is their Ability Score Improvement.
	<br><br>Each variant human has a set of Born Traits and a set of Raised Traits. It is up to the player which, if any, they choose to adopt. A human may be born in one place and raised in another, depending on their backstory and the GM's allowance.
	 
	
	<hr>
	
	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Born Traits </b>
	<br> These are the traits you gain for being born in Enthan.
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Ability Score Improvements </b>
		<br> The Tarian people are quick to adapt and learn. Though they have very different ideas of what is most worth learning and adapting to, they share in a sort of quickness that the rest of the world struggles to overcome. They gain a <b>+1 racial bonus</b> to <b>dexterity</b>, <b>intelligence</b>, and a <b>+1 racial bonus</b> to a score of their <b>choice</b>.
		<br> This replaces the core human ability score modifications.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Raised Traits </b>
	<br> These are the traits you gain for being raised in Taria. You can choose to be raised in any of the city-states, but you must take the corresponding two traits for the one you select.
	<br> Whichever trait set you pick, it replaces the core human Bonus Feat trait and Skilled trait.
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Camus: </b>
		<br> The historic 'capitol' of Taria and the seat of power of Athena, goddess of wisdom, the city of Camus is home to the most scholarly and educated individuals in That Which Exists. Their famous magical university, the University of Camus, stands ready to teach and train only the brightest minds. Anyone who is raised here, whether they attened the university or not, is taught the basics of magic and how the world works.
		<br><br> <u>Basic Magic Training-</u> You know Read Magic and 2 other tier-0 spells and 1 tier-1 spell from any spell list, your choice. If you are a spellcaster, then choose a school of magic and gain the Spell Focus(school) feat. You can cast the tier 1 you select this way a number of times equal to your intelligence modifier, regardless of your class.
		<br><br> <u>Well-Studied-</u> Select 3 Knowledge skills. If you are not trained in them, then become trained in them. If you are already trained in them, then gain the skill focus feat for those skills.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Motham: </b>
		<br> The smallest and most obscure city-state is hidden in the mountains north of Camus. Motham is home to the seat of power of the goddess of magic, Hecate. Here, magic seems to almost flow through the air and inundates all those who dwell here. Unlike the conventional casting of Camus, the residents of Motham prefer to feel the magic more organically. It is not uncommon for more unconventional and even taboo magics to be practiced freely here. Physical arms and armor, on the other hand, are seen as distateful and even taboo themselves.
		<br><br> <u>Magical Implementation-</u> You may use a magical item such as a wand, staff, or rod as a weapon, dealing damage and gaining bonus effects as suitable for the item. 
		<br><br> <u>Magical Device Use-</u> You are trained in Use Magic Device. If you are already trained in it, then you gain the Skill Focus(Use Magic Device) feat. You may attempt Use Magic Device to use any such item, regardless of your magical affinity, with a 25% chance to avoid expending its charge/energy (if applicable).

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Shinta: </b>
		<br> Shinta is a small and quaint town nestled at the base of Mount Olympus, the seat of Zeus, the god of the heavens. Shinta is a peaceful town that knows no violence, instead residing under the gentle protection of their god and his powerful protectors. The people here rely on Zeus' benevolence for their food and thrive, so they seek to show similar hospitality to any and all who appear at their doors. Being able to give a good gift is among the most enviable skills in Shinta.
		<br><br> <u>Cheerful Giver-</u> When you give an item to a creature who you think would particularly like it, you may roll either a diplomacy, sense motive, or Handle Animal, depending on the situation (hostile people need diplomacy, other people need sense motive, and animals need handle animal). Doing so may cause the creature to shift its relationship to you. A neutral creature becomes friendly and trusting, an already friendly creature feels a strong desire to repay you, and a hostile creature may lose their hostility to you or even your allies.
		<br><br> <u>Generous Intuition-</u> Select 2 of the following skills: Diplomacy, Sense Motive, and Handle Animal. You are now trained in those skills. If you are already trained in those skills, you instead gain the Skill Focus feat for them. In addition, you may use one of those 3 skills, as appropriate, to try and dig deeper into a creature's heart to see what things it might like.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Bismuth: </b>
		<br> Port Bismuth is a large, bustling, eternally moving center of culture and commerce. The citizens of Bismuth are trained from an early age to spot a deal and a deceiver a mile away. Learning to navigate a conversation is even more important than navigating a ship or city here, where money reigns and fortune smiles on the bold. In the richest city in That Which Exists, a quick with is more deadly than a quick blade.
		<br><br> <u>Economical Insight-</u> You may attempt an Appraise check to perceive a limited version of the history of a coin or other piece of currency you can examine. This functions much like the Blood Biography spell, but on currency, allowing you to view what sort of purposes it has been used for.
		<br><br> <u>Socially Adept-</u> Select 3 from the following list of skills: Appraise, Diplomacy, Bluff, Sleight of Hand, Craft. If you are not trained in them, then become trained in them. If you are already trained in them, then gain the spell focus feat for those skills.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Morta: </b>
		<br> Morta is the northern village of the Tri-Villages. It is devoted to the art of the polearm, featuring the home of a unique fighting style feared the world over. The mercenaries trained here, known as Spearmasters, take pride in their strength and constantly challenge each other to battle. While not every citizen becomes a Spearmaster, every one is taught the basics.
		<br><br> <u>Polearm training-</u> Select a simple or martial polearm. If you are not proficient with it, then you become proficient. If you are proficient already, then you gain the weapon focus feat for that weapon. While you are wielding this weapon, you gain a +1 shield bonus to your ac. 
		<br><br> <u>Opportunistic Flurry-</u> If a creature performs multiple actions that provoke attacks of opportunity, or if they move in a way that might provoke more than one attack of opportunity, you may take those opportunities, only spending one attack of opportunity total to do so.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Carta: </b>
		<br> Carta is the eastern village of the Tri-Villages. It is devoted to the art of the bow, featuring the home of a unique fighting style feared the world over. The mercenaries trained here, known as Bowmasters, take pride in their precision and constantly challenge each other to battle. While not every citizen becomes a Bowmaster, every one is taught the basics.
		<br><br> <u>Ranged weapon training-</u> Select a bow, crossbow, or thrown weapon of some kind. Become proficient in the use of that weapon. If you are already proficient, then gain the weapon focus feat for that weapon. While you are wielding this weapon, increase the critical threat range by 1 (this is calculated AFTER doubling effects such as keen).
		<br><br> <u>Opportunistic Intervention-</u> If a ranged attack passes through your space or any space you threaten, then you may spend an attack of opportunity to negate that attack, as per the Deflect Arrows feat. 

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> Werta: </b>
		<br> Werta is the western village of the Tri-Villages. It is devoted to the use of a specific magical art known as mana, featuring the home of a unique fighting style feared the world over. The mercenaries trained here, known as Manabound, take pride in their discipline and constantly challenge each other to battle. While not every citizen becomes a Manabound, every one is taught the basics of unarmed combat.
		<br><br> <u>Unarmed Training-</u> You gain the Improved Unarmed Fighting feat. If you already have this feat, then increase the critical multiplier of your unarmed attacks by 1.
		<br><br> <u>Opportunistic Versatility-</u> When making an attack of opportunity, you may choose to use a combat maneuver instead of an attack roll.
