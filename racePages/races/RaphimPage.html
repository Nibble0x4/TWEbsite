	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> The Raphim are an intellectual race that have lived in the Heavens since time immemorial. They have built a society in the Cumulant layer, hunting and gathering in the Strattal layer for substantial needs while entertaining themselves on an intellectual level by engaging with the more complicated mechanics of their world. Glimpses of these beings are thought to be the primary idea behind 'angels', and though there is no known contact between the people of TWE and the Raphim, this is not due to any natural distaste or hatred. Rather, the Raphim have been entirely content to live and work in peace in the Heavens whilst the War of the Winds whistled about their ears.
	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> Raphia men and women are built both powerfully and beautifully, their forms often considered to be the standard for humanoids. They move smoothly, powerfully, and their features are pleasant. Their expressions are often placid, almost stoic, but that is not because of any secrecy or emotionless tendencies. Rather, it is because they are unaccustomed to using their faces to express their emotions. Each Raphim bears a Halo of light over their head, an intangible light construct that changes shape and color fluidly to depict their mood. Curiosity, anger, surprise, love, every emotion that humans can convey in their faces is shown plainly atop the heads of the Raphim. It is also common for depictions of 'angels' to include great white wings. The Raphim do possess the ability to manifest cloudy white wings at will, but they find them somewhat bulky for everyday use and have learned to banish them when they are not needed.

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> Raphia culture is one of peace and harmony. They enjoy living at peace with each other and with all other races, insofar as they can manage it. In the Heavens, they can. They fill their days seeking harmony in their relationships and in their work, using their keen minds to mold and tinker their surroundings into satisfying systems that delight their senses. The unique ice-crystal structure of the Heavens lends itself well to the natural magics of the Raphim, allowing them to functionally program their surroundings to perform highly precise and optimized functions. Whether it be a self-opening door, a window that moves throughout the day, or a bridge that extends itself over a gap, the Raphim delight in creating well-designed systems that can spring to life at their touch.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Functionality </b>
		<br> Raphim are powerful and intelligent beings, but they struggle to break the habits formed by generations of uninterrupted peace. They struggle to perform well in lethal combat, causing them to thrive better in supportive or defensive roles.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> These are the basic traits natural to Raphim

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>
		<br> The Raphim are beautiful and strong, intelligent and without apparent flaw.
		<br><br> +2 Str, +2 Int, +2 Cha


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Base Speed </b>
		<br> Raphim can sprout wings, granting them a fly speed in addition to their base movement speed.
		<br><br> Raphim have a base movement speed of 30 feet, with a fly speed of 20 speed when they sprout their wings. They cannot fly when they are overburdened.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>
		<br> Raphim are Medium creatures and thus have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.
		<br> When her wings are sprouted, Raphim are treated as Large creatures for most effects, but her statistics do not otherwise change.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Raphim are humanoids with the angel subtype.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Heavenly Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br> <u>Electric Resistance:</u>  Raphim gain a resistance to electricity equal to their character level.
		<br> <u>Energy Generation:</u> The Raphim can spend 1 action to infuse an item she is holding with electricity. If this is a weapon, it will deal an additional 1d4 electric damage on its next successful hit against a non-Adumbrate creature. The electric damage increases at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 6d4 damage at 20th level.
		<br><br> <u>Peaceful Upbringing:</u> The Raphim are not accustomed to battle. They find it difficult to bring harm to others and, as a result, may inflict nonlethal damage with a melee weapon without the usual penalty. Instead, they suffer a -4 penalty on attack rolls to deal lethal damage. If they attempt to cast a damaging spell upon a creature who would be hurt by it, then they must make a concentration check or risk losing the spell.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Magical Abilities </b>
		<br><br><b><u>Wings of the Raphim:</u></b> As an action, a Raphia can conjure a set of great white cloudy wings on her back. These wings are large enough to cause her to be considered 1 size category larger than normal when considering how much space she covers and how easy she is to hit.  
		<br>Her wings can be targeted separately from her. They have AC equal to her AC without any armor or shield bonuses and they have HP equal to half the HP she has when she conjures them. 
		<br> She can dismiss her wings as an action. If she conjures them again today, they keep any damage they sustained previously that day.
		<br> If her wings are destroyed, then she cannot conjure them again until she has experienced a full night's rest. 
		<br><br><b><u>Under my Wings:</u></b> As an action, while her wings are active, a Raphia can choose to extend her wings over any creatures who are adjacent to her. If she does, she may add her Charisma modifier to the AC and Saves of those creatures she protects. She may not provide this bonus to herself or another Raphia with her wings active. No creature may benefit from this effect twice. If the protected creature is damaged while under this effect, the damage instead goes to the Wings of the Raphia. If this damage would destroy her wings, then the remainder is dealt to the original intended target.
		<br><br><b><u>Object State Memory:</u></b> The Raphim have the ability to spend 2 actions to force a small object to memorize its current state. The object cannot be magical and can only have 1 state memorized. Later, as an action, she can cause the object to revert to its memorized state. As an action, she can also cause the object to return to the state it was in previous to being reverted.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Other Racial Traits </b>
		<br><br><u>Halo:</u> Each Raphia has a halo over her head that displays her current emotions. This means that she can communicate her feelings to anyone who can see her. It also means she cannot hide her feelings from anyone who can see her. 
		<br> Her halo sheds a dim light and cannot be hidden under clothing or hats, making stealth difficult. She takes a -2 penalty to stealth that increases as her surroundings become darker.
