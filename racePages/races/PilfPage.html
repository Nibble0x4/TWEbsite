	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> History </b>
	<br> The history of the Pilfs is shrowded in mystery and secrecy, much like their very existence. Very few people outside of the Pilfs themselves are even aware that they exist, let alone their history. Among the Pilfs themselves, writing is seen as risky and kept to a minimum wherever possible, so little long-standing history is kept. There are rumors, though, that all surround their great patron Aoratos. Some say he formed the race in secret, a mockery of the proud beings that walk the land like they own it. Others say he made the Pilfs out of a desire to, in some small part, enjoy the love and adoration the gods receive. Still others claim that the Pilfs were once humans that were cursed and cast out by the other gods, only to be found and saved by Aoratos' mercy.
	<br>Regardless of how it may have occurred, the Pilfs are here now, and they have been so for what seems like a very long time. How long, nobody can say, but such matters seem small, even to the Pilfs.



	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Appearance </b>
	<br> The Pilfs are the smallest race in TWE, averaging a mere 1-2 inches in height at maturity. Their form is humanoid, eerily similar to a human, with a few exceptions. Their eyes and ears are much larger, relative to their heads, than their human counterparts. Their eyes and hair and skin colors are all those you might find on a human, and they bear no other oddities...at birth, that is. Once they have come of age and received their gifts from the great Aoratos, they sometimes change in very strange ways. 


	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Culture </b>
		<br> The Pilf culture is wildly diverse, much like the humans they so closely resemble. Pilfs live in all corners of the world, but are far more highly concentrated in larger, denser, more populated 'Big' settlements. The settlements of 'the Bigs' provide an intrigueing opportunity for Pilfs, a mixture of danger and opportunity. The Pilfs have no access to many of the resources gathered and used by bigger races, such as iron, crops, transportation, and tools. As a result, the Pilfs seek to live amongst the bigs and steal what they need whenever the Bigs might miss it. A spare needle, easily lost by a careless Big, can function as an excellent weapon in the hands of a Pilf. A square of cheese can feed a family of Pilfs for days. The Pilfs have greater odds of surviving and thriving when they can take from the Bigs, but in so doing they play with danger. 
	<br> The big races are a danger to Pilfs in more ways than one might initially think. Of course, given their size difference, the Pilfs are in great danger if a Big decides to attack them. However, the danger is far greater than that. The Pilfs rely heavily on the gifts given to them by their patron, Aoratos, for survival in the cut-throat world of the small. Aoratos, however, has made himself very clear: Any Pilf who is discovered by a Big is no longer under his protection. For many Pilfs, this is regarded as a fate worse than death. If a Pilf is ever discovered, they are utterly forsaken and cast out. Their families and friends forsake them, their lives and homes are upended and they are cast adrift in the dangerous world without even the gifts of their great patron to help them. The shame and fear that comes with being discovered outweigh even the threat of death, and so living amongst the Bigs is a dangerous prospect. Nevertheless, it is this very danger that provides the thrill that Pilfs thrive on, so most Pilfs choose to live in Big settlements, hiding in walls, pipes, floors, ceilings, crevices, tunnels, and other places just out of sight. 
	<br> Pilfs are born incredibly weak and frail. Their bodies are never strong, not by any comparison to Bigs, but they begin life at a serious disadvantage even amongst their fellows. They must prove themselves somehow, the exact method of proving being variable depending on the location, group, and propensitites of the maturing Pilf, before they can come of age and be rewarded their gifts by their patron, Aoratos. These gifts change everything for a young Pilf. They give them new powers or even changes to their forms that better equip them for life in the world of the small.
	<br> Pilfs are small, but age no faster nor any slower than their human counterparts. They live to the same age as Bigs tend to, if they get the chance to die of old age.

	<p class="body-text"> <b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:32px"> Racial Traits </b>
		<br> These are the basic traits natural to Pilfs.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Ability Scores </b>
		<br>  Pilfs, like humans, are incredibl diverse and capable of great variation. As a result, the player has two choices for Ability Score bonuses: 
		<br> Pilfs gain a +2 bonus to any Ability Score of their choice, as a human.
		<br> OR, a Pilf can gain a +2 bonus to two ability scores of their choice, but must also gain a -2 penalty to 2 ability scores of their choice (The bonuses and penalties can be chosen to apply to the same ability, if desired. Ex: A +4 str, -2 con, -2 int is acceptable. So is +2 cha, +2 dex, -4 wis. And, finally, +2 str, +2 dex, -2 int, -2 wis is also acceptable.)


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Base Speed </b>
		<br> Pilfs measure space differently than Bigs do. Since they are so small, they only 4 square inches of space. Thus, they use Motes instead of feet. 1 Mote is equal to 2 inches. 
		<br> Pilfs measure their spaces in Motes, rather than feet. Instead of a 5-foot square ( 30 Mote square for Pilfs), they battle in 1 Mote squares.
		<br> Pilfs have a base movement speed of 5 Motes, and treat diagonal Motes as the same for movement purposes as any other direction.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Size </b>
		<br> Pilfs are absolutely miniscule, with the smallest size used by Bigs calling them Fine. Even amongst Fine creatures, they are less than half the size of some. Thus, they gain the following bonuses and penalties due to their size:
		<br> Pilfs gain a +8 bonus to ac and attack rolls.
		<br> Pilfs gain a -8 penalty to CMB and CMD.
		<br> Pilfs gain a +8 bonus on fly and ride checks.
		<br> Pilfs gain a +16 bonus to stealth checks and sleight of hand checks against Bigs.
		<br> <u> Damage Scaling
			<br> Pilfs use the weapon damage scales as Medium creatures (so a dagger sized for a Pilf does 1d4 damage, just like one sized for a medium creature). However, Pilfs are at an extreme disadvantage when fighting larger opponents. For each size category larger the opponent is, damage dealt BY a Pilf is divided by (2 * the number of size categories larger the opponent is) and damage dealt TO a Pilf is multiplied by the same value. 
			<br> EXAMPLE: A Pilf (Fine) attacking a human (Medium) with 86 damage has their damage divided by 8 ( Fine->Diminutive->Tiny->Small->Medium is 4 categories larger, * 2 = 8 ), meaning they would actually deal 86/8 = 10 (rounded down). A halfling (Small) attacking a Pilf with 3 damage has a multiplier of 6 ( Fine->Diminutive->Tiny->Small is 3 categories larger, * 2 = 6 ), so they would deal 3 * 6 = 18 damage to the Pilf.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Type </b>
		<br> Pilfs are humanoids with the Pilf subtype.


		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Gifts of Aoratos </b>
		<br> Upon coming of age, a Pilf may choose gifts to receive from their patron, Aoratos. The coming of age event can differ for each Pilf, but by default it corresponds with reaching character level 1. When this occurs, the Pilf has 4 Favor Points they may spend on some of the following gifts:
		<br> <u>Skilled(1):</u>  Select 2 skills. You gain a +4 bonus on those skills. For every 5 ranks you put into the skill, increase the bonus by 2.
		<br> <u>Enhanced(2):</u>  Select 2 ability scores. You gain a +2 bonus to one and a -2 penalty to the other.

		<br><br><b style="color:#044440; background:lightgrey; font-size:24px"> Magical Abilities </b>
