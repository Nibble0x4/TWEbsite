			<br> 
		<div class="classFeature">
			<br><br><b class="windSubHeader">Wind Kick [ 1 Mana ] [ BASIC ]</b>
			<br> Wrap your foot with wind and jump kick your foe.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as part of an unarmed strike. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 + 1 bludgeoning damage and you may immediately move 5 feet in any direction as a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 bludgeoning damage and 5 feet to the free movement.

			<br><br><br><b class="windSubHeader">Wind Sprint [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Call the winds to your side as you move, defying gravity.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as a part of a move action, and it increases your movement speed by 30 feet. If you strike a foe with an unarmed strike this turn after using this Tac, add +1 bludgeoning damage to the first hit.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add 5 feet and 1 bludgeoning damage.

			<br><br><br><b class="windSubHeader">Tempest Strike [ 4 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Bear down on your foe with the force of all the winds that have propelled you, striking them with all the force you can muster.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as a part of an unarmed strike. This Tac deals an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage + 1 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet you have traveled this turn. You cannot use this Tac in conjunction with the Run action.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: 1 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet you have traveled this turn.

			<br><br><br><b class="windSubHeader">Tornado Whirl [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Spin the wind and yourself along with it, tossing your limbs through the air like a ragdoll.
			<br>
			Increase your reach by 5 feet and make an unarmed attack against every creature in range.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase your reach by 5 more feet.

			<br><br><br><b class="windSubHeader">Shoot the Breeze [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Use the winds to close the distance between yourself and anyone foolish enough to throw something at you.
			<br>
			As an attack of opportunity, when they are missed by a ranged attack, you may cast this Tac to move up to your movement speed. This movement speed does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If your movement ends within reach of a creature, you may make an unarmed attack with +2 bludgeoning damage. 
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the bludgeoning damage by +2.

			<br><br><br><b class="windSubHeader">Wind Shear [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Command the wind to crash down on a single creature within 30 feet of you that you choose. 
			<br>
			That creature must make a fortitude save to halve 1d8 + 1 damage. If they fail the save, then they cannot take attacks of opportunity for this round.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>:  Increase the DC by 1 and the damage by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="windSubHeader">Updraft [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Gather wind low, then rush it upward at a foe within reach, attempting to blow them into the sky.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as an action that provokes an attack of opportunity. If the target fails a fortitude save, then they are launched upward up to 10 feet.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>:   Increase the DC by 1 and the launch distance by 5 feet.

			<br><br><br><b class="windSubHeader">Winds of Fortune [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> When you would be struck by a physical attack, you may cast this Tac as an immediate action.
			<br>
			If you do, you increase your ac by 1 and summon a gust of wind to move you up to your movement speed. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>:   Increase the AC bonus by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="windSubHeader">Windy Veil [ 0 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Wrap yourself with the winds, creating an invisible shield protecting you from the dangers that fly in the air.
			<br>
			This Tac tcan be cast as an action or as a part of another Wind Tac. While this veil is active, the winds give you cover offering a 50% chance to deflect light projectiles from you. (This is useful against arrows, daggers, stones, bullets, and other similar physical projectiles. Heavy projectiles such as cannonballs are unlikely to be impacted.) In addition, the winds cushion you so that you are not subjected to fall damage.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>:   This Tac cannot be ranked up.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="electricHeader"> Electric Tacs </b>
			<br> 
		<div class="classFeature">
			<br><br><b class="electricSubHeader">Electric Elbow [ 1 Mana ] [ BASIC ]</b>
			<br> Strike your foe with an elbow wreathed in electricity.
			<br>
			This Tac is cast as part of an unarmed strike. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 + 1 electric damage. If the target is below you and not in contact with ground, then it deals triple the electric damage.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: add +1 electric damage.

			<br><br><br><b class="electricSubHeader">Bolt Trip- [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Build electricity in your limbs then reach out and touch a creature, filling them with charge and sending them plummeting to the ground.
			<br>
			Make a touch attack against the target. If they are airborne, they take 1d6+1 points of electric damage and immediately get pulled out of the sky down to the earth. For every 10 feet they fall, they take 1 electric damage, in addition to the regular fall damage that a creature such as they might take. If the creature is under the effects of feather fall or fly or other effects that remove fall damage, they take fall damage anyway.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the initial electric damage by 1, and the electric damage for each 10 foot fall by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="electricSubHeader">Chain Attack- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Build a charge in your body as you strike a foe, then allow that charge to guide you toward the closest un-hit foe.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as part of an unarmed strike. If the attack hits, deal an additional 1 electric damage then move toward the closest creature within your movement speed and make another unarmed strike. Keep doing this until you miss or until there are no other creatures in range. You may choose to aim horribly in order to miss on purpose. For each consecutive foe you hit, deal +1 electric damage.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the bonus electric damage by 1

			<br><br><br><b class="electricSubHeader">Defeating Discharge- [ 2 Mana ]</b>
			<br> When knocking a foe unconscious, you use their body as a capacitor and pull energy from them.
			<br>
			You may cast this Tac as an immediate action as a part of an unarmed strike that defeats an opponent. You gain in your body 1d8+2 electric damage that you store and do not take. This damage is not released until you are struck by an enemy attack, at which point all your built up electricity is released at all creatures within a 10 foot radius, with a reflex save to halve the damage. 
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the damage by 2 and the reflex DC by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="electricSubHeader">Charged Flurry- [ 4 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Face down a single foe and unleash a flurry of increasingly charged strikes intended to wipe them out, personally. 
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as an immediate action after a successful unarmed strike involving an Electric Tac struck an enemy. You may make an unarmed strike against this foe at your highest Base Attack Bonus with a +1 electric damage. If your attack hits, you may do so again with a -4 attack modifier and an additional +1 electric damage more than your last hit. You may continue to do this until you miss. A natural 1 causes you to strike yourself. You may not target any other creatures with these attacks, just your initial target.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the stacking electric damage by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="electricSubHeader">Static Shock- [ 1 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Charge an airborne target with electricity that is just waiting for an outlet.
			<br>
			You may cast this tac as an action that requires a successful touch attack or as a part of an unarmed strike. The next time the creature touches ground or any structure, creature or other conductive material that is connected to ground, it and any creatures in contact with it takes 2d6+2 points of electric damage.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the damage by 2.

			<br><br><br><b class="electricSubHeader">Jarring Shock- [ 3 Mana ]</b>
			<br> Turn a foe’s metallic protection into a trap of arcing electricity.
			<br>
			This Tac can be cast as a part of an unarmed strike. If the target is wearing metallic armor, deal 1d8+2 electric damage and, if they fail a fortitude save, they are Jolted for 1 turn. 
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: Increase the damage by 2 and the DC by 1.

			<br><br><br><b class="electricSubHeader">Electrostatic Excess- [ 1 Mana ] [ EXCLUSIVE ]</b>
			<br> Release excess charge building up in your body as a result of an electric Tac, sending it another creature within reach.
			<br>
			When you strike with a successful Electric Tac, you can cast this Tac as an immediate action to channel additional electricity into any creature within reach or, if you are airborne, who is within reach of a space directly beneath you. If you do, they must make a reflex save to halve electric damage equal to the amount you just dealt to your target. This Tac can only be cast once per round.
			<br>
			<i><b>Rankup Effect</b></i>: This Tac cannot be ranked up.
