	<p class="text"> <b class="subheader"> Classes in That Which Exists </b>
	<br>In TWE, there are many different ways people live out there lives. There are many ways to adventure through the world, whether it be by cunning tricks, powerful weapons, magical acumen, or a host of other methods, these differences split adventurers up into "Classes." These classes represent the powers and abilities your character have at their disposal, and they play a massive part in your experience in That Which Exists. 
	<br><br>This page is simply a hub page, displaying the classes that are currently playable in TWE. Check out the classes themselves on their own pages.

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Core Classes </b>
	<br> These are called the core classes because they represent the core ideas found at the center of all classes. These classes are purists, focusing on what makes them special without bridging into each other's territory. We have pure arcane casters, cunning pickpockets, mighty warriors, devout priests, experienced survivalists, discplined martial artists, skilled entertainers, and forces of nature. 
	<br><br> These classes are excellent for new players and veterans alike, offering pure and simple character archetypes that are easy to understand but compelling enough to stand the test of time.
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter">Fighter</a> </b>
		<br> This is your man-at-arms, a master of every weapon and suit of armor imaginable. These warriors are the most reliable out there, blending a wealth of martial experience with the bravery to look a dragon in the face, brandish a sharpened stick, and get to work.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian">Barbarian</a> </b>
		<br> Barbarians are the most simplistic and terrifying warriors to step onto the battlefield. They are the toughest around, able to take the most punishment before giving in. They are unmatched in raw strength, and possess the ability to enter a battle frenzy that makes them even stronger and tougher. They know only one thing: They have a weapon, and they are going to smash you with it.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk">Monk</a> </b>
		<br> Monks are the masters of unarmed combat, developing their bodies into the ultimate weapons. They attack faster than any other class, with rapid series of jabs and kicks and headbutts that keep their opponents guessing. With the addition of their spiritual Ki energy giving them supernatural powers, they are a versatile warrior who can adapt to any situation.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin">Paladin</a> </b>
		<br> These are the holy warriors and paragons of virtue. These white knights are heavily armored protectors of the weak, trained in strong sword and stout shield. They dabble in divine magics, just enough godly favor to help them heal their allies and smite the evil of the world. 

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric">Cleric</a></b>
		<br> Clerics are the followers of the gods. They receive power from on high, using it to bring comfort and relief to their allies in the form of protection and succor. Their enemies, however, are faced with the divine wrath of their god and the terror of their expertly wielded sacred weapons.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard">Bard</a> </b>
		<br> The Bard is an entertainer at heart, a role with a wide range of applications. At the core of it all, they are traveling with their instrument in hand to bring support to their allies and a sense of adventure that no other class can hope to match. Whether it be the swashbuckling pirate with a heart singing voice, the dainty harpist smoothly sidestepping her enemies to the tune of her strings, or an eager violinist just looking forward to what the next road will bring him, the bard is sure to bring a sense of style to their battles.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue">Rogue</a> </b>
		<br> Thieves, scoundrels, tricksters, and charlatans. These are the traditional labels attached to those who creep in the shadows. The rogue can be all of these and more. An assassin, a benevolent swindler, a pickpocket, or a grifter, the rogue has many forms but they all move with a level of cunning and precision unmatched by any other class.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger">Ranger</a> </b>
		<br> Practiced survivalists, hunters, and friends of the natural world. The Rangers are often archers, but can train in a different style if they wish. What makes a ranger is their connection to nature, which might take the form of a loyal animal companion, and their reliance on a mixture of experience and instinct to help them defeat their enemies.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid">Druid</a> </b>
		<br> The Druids act as the arm of nature itself. Accompanied by an animal companion and the ability to turn into any animal they desire, the druid would be dangerous enough without the ability to cast nature spells. Druids can fight, heal, summon the forces of nature, transform their bodies, and generally handle any situation put in front of them.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer">Sorcerer</a> </b>
		<br> Some among us are born with the power of magc flowing through their veins. For sorcerers, this is very literal. Sorcerers harness the power of ancestral magic, wielding their bloodlines to cast spells with unparalleled power and versatility. Their bodies may be frail, but anyone foolish enough to challenge them will be hard pressed to kill them before being overtaken by their sheer magical might.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard">Wizard</a> </b>
		<br> Wizard is a title that is thrown around too loosely. To the layman, a wizard is a spellcaster, but the term means so much more. Wizards have dedicated their lives to studying and uncovering the secrets of arcane magic, and as such are unparalleled in their understanding. They carry a compendium of magic in their tomes and wield a breadth of magical spells that no other caster can hope to contest. They must take more care in preparing their spells than others do, but they are no strangers to thinking things through.
	</p>

<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Base Classes </b>
	<br> The Base Classes are more complex than their Core friends. They represent different ideas and fresh takes, but they all draw from the ideas and mechanics at play in the Core Classes. The classes tend to present a slightly diminished version of the Core classes along with a unique idea or theme or mechanic that is added in to make it all feel fresh and new and, coincidentally, more complicated.
	<br><br> These classes are suggested for players who have become familiar with the basics of the game and crave a deeper mechanical experience than they find in the Core Classes.
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist">Alchemist</a> </b>
		<br> The alchemist is what happens when you take a mad scientist and tell them about magic. Magic can, apparently, be placed in a test tube and Alchemists have plenty of it. They play with extracts (spells that are placed into potion bottles), mutagens (steroid injections), and even bombs that can be tossed at their enemies. The Alchemist is a tough one to predict, and they thrive off of it.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner">Summoner</a> </b>
		<br> The summoner is a specialist in exactly what it sounds like. He can summon creatures from the furthest extent of reality to do his bidding and fight for him. While he can summon hordes of creatures to help him in battle, he has one true ally in his Eidolon, an extradimensional creature with which he has formed a bond and whose form he can mold and shape to fit his will. The Eidolon is like an animal companion, but it cannot die. Instead, it is simply temporarily banished back to its home plane of existence until the Summoner summons it again. 

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch">Witch</a> </b>
		<br> Witches are the masters of fringe magic. They are often mistaken for wizards, since they cast in a manner that is practically identical, the magic they know is stored in the mind of a familiar instead of a spellbook. In addition, they trade their years of magical experience and wealth of knowledge for hexes, magic tricks that can be used more regularly and for spells that can curse and debilitate their foes. A witch is less likely to burn you to death with a fireball than she is to systematically remove your senses and cause your flesh to shrivel and die.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle">Oracle</a> </b>
		<br> Magic is seen as a boon, but the Oracle knows that that is not always purely the case. The Oracle did not choose her power, her power chose her. Much like the Oracle at Delphi, the unknown power of the divinities that don't wish to reveal themselves brings both aid and pain. Oracles gain power in the form of a Mystery, but it is always accompanied by a Curse as well. The Curse limits her abilities, but the Oracle eventually learns to use even that to her advantage after she spends enough time toiling with it. 

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/inquisitor">Inquisitor</a> </b>
		<br> Inquisitors are an interesting breed of divine caster. They serve a deity like a cleric would, but they are less interested in wielding their god's divine power and more interested in punishing those who oppose that deity. Inquisitors exceed in dicovering truth and meting out judgment to those they deem deserving. They do not wield as much magical might as a cleric, but they augment that with martial prowess to ensure that they can hunt down any and every offender and bring them to whatever kind of justice their deity prefers.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/shifter">Shifter</a> </b>
		<br> Shifters saw the Druids turn into animals and thought "I can do that, but better." Shifters are highly efficient warriors with the power to change their bodies to reflect aspects of animals from nature. A shifter might morph his hands into tiger claws, leap high into the air with frog legs and then begin soaring as an eagle. He might call upon the strength of a bull or the speed of an antelope and the reflexes of a snake. He might throw caution to the wind and transform his entire body into a bear to fight his foes. Whatever his opponent, the shifter can adapt his form and his strategy to fight them. He cannot cast spells, but he makes do without such things.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/cavalier">Cavalier</a> </b>
		<br> Cavaliers dedicate themselves to a cause more than to a fighting style. They tend to excel at mounted combat, but they truly shine on the battlefield when priorities are questioned. They carry a banner with them to encourage their allies, call out orders to help comrades fight together in a coordinated effort, and challenge specific foes who they deem particularly problematic. The cavalier specializes in controlling the flow of battle to ensure that his purpose is fulfilled and his allies see victory.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger">Gunslinger</a> </b>
		<br> The Gunslinger is a fresh and burgeoning style of combatant that, like the weapons he wields, has yet to be proven. He is a rare breed of warrior wielding a weapon few have ever seen at this point in TWE, and this means the gunslingers out there have to have a solid amount of grit to them. They carry weapons that can backfire and explode at any time, and yet they use them anyway. They see the future of warfare and they intend to pioneer it.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Hybrid Classes </b>
	<br> The Hybrid Classes are classes made up entirely of the combination of two existing classes from the Core or Base classes. Each of them have two parent classes, and play as a hybrid of the two. 
	<br><br> These classes are for those who enjoy the concepts shown in Core and Base classes, but wish to have several of them at the same time. Players who like the odea of mashing two character types into one will have a blast with hybrid classes.
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/arcanist">Arcanist</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Wizard and Sorcerer.</b> The Arcanist combines the intellect of a wizard with the innate powers of the sorcerer's bloodline to become the most versatile caster in existence. Arcanists cast spells like a wizard, but have powers in their blood that lets them break the rules of magic with things called Exploits. With these, Arcanists can cast spells in ways that no other mage could dream of.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/shaman">Shaman</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Oracle and Witch.</b> The Shaman truly exhibits the best of both worlds. Combining the reliability of the witch's hexes and the divine power of the Oracle, the Shaman eschews any Curse for the favor of Spirits who follow her around and grant her new powers whenever she wishes it. It pays to be friends with the spirits, and the Shaman is a fearful foe for exactly that reason.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus">Magus</a> </b>
		<br>  <b>Parent Classes: Wizard and Fighter.</b> The Magus is a student of both blade and book, spear and spell, armor and the arcane. For he who wishes to cast spells in the most direct way possible, the Magus provides Spellstrike. A Magus can imbue his weapon with spells from his book and unleash its power by striking his opponents down with it. The Magus combines the martial prowess of the fighter with the intellectual spellcasting of the wizard to become a deadly blur of magic and might.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/bloodrager">Bloodrager</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Barbarian and Sorcerer.</b> The Bloodrager takes the sheer power of the barbarian and combines it with the bloodline powers of the sorcerer. Instead of focusing on casting spells in addition to smacking their enemies, the bloodrager lets the power of their blood manifest in their rage. A bloodrager may not cast many spells in battle, but their ferocious rage will be magical enough to help them see to your demise.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/warpriest">WarPriest</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Cleric and Fighter.</b> The Warpriest is what happens when a cleric yearns for battle. While clerics are no slouches in the combat department, warpriests take it several steps further. Their spellcasting is not as extensive as their more traditional brothers and sisters, but warpriests gain the ability to enhance their sacred weapons and armor with the might of their god and either heal or harm with their fervor alone.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/hunter">Hunter</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Druid and Ranger.</b> The Hunter is what happens if you take the Druid and the Ranger, combine their skills, and make them really care about their animal companion. The Hunter can cast more spells than Rangers and less than Druids, but their survival skills surpass either one. They form sucha  close bond with their companion that they learn to extend their magic to strengthen them and fight at their side in different well-practiced Forms that enhance their fighting prowess.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/skald">Skald</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Bard and Barbarian.</b> The Bardbarian (Skald) is an entertainer who focuses less on the traditional happy feelings that come from a bard's music and focus on inspriting something more primal. Her performances bring to mind the heat of battle and glorious victory, inciting a battle frenzy akin to a barbarian's rage within the hearts of her hearers. She cares more for the history and lore for the world around her, seeking to not only learn it, but to record it herself and pass it to others.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/investigator">Investigator</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Alchemist and Rogue.</b> The Investigator combines the curiosity and quick-wittedness of the rogue with the curiosity and in-depth analysis of the alchemist to create the most adaptive mind and learned body around. The Investigator excels in using their quick mind and reflexes to analyze the situation before them and come up with an inspired plan to solve whatever problems they face.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/swashbuckler">Swashbuckler</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Gunslinger and Fighter.</b> The Swashbuckler is the epitome of style and finesse in melee combat. They specialize only in the use of light or one-handed melee piercing weapons, and thus are more limited in their weapon use, but are incredibly proficient with their blades of choice. The Swashbuckler brings to mind images of a suave and dashing combatant with an elegant rapier and a confident smirk deftly parrying his opponent and relieving them of their weapon. The Swashbuckler thrives on style and panache, using successes to fuel further daring deeds.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/slayer">Slayer</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Rogue and Ranger.</b> The Slayer is, for all intents and purposes, an assassin. She combines the hunting and tracking capabilities of the ranger with the stealth and disguise skills of the rogue to create the worst nightmare of anyone with a target on their backs. She pays close attention in battle, studying specific targets to enable greater precision and damage against them.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/brawler">Brawler</a> </b>
		<br> <b>Parent Classes: Monk and Fighter.</b> The Brawler is what happens when a monk sees no value in mysticism and turns to the possibility of using other weapons beyond their fists. While the Brawler is plenty capable with their unarmed attacks, he can seemlessly transition between his fists and a blade he just picked up off the ground. Like the fighter whose wide breadth of combat experience allows her to collect more feats than any other class, the Brawler gains the ability to swap feats out mid-fight to essentially shift between self-created styles to fit the current battle.

	</p>

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Unique Classes </b>
		<br> These are the house specials, these classes were created specifically for TWE. These classes tend to be more specifically related to TWE than the others, and as such may be tied to the lore of the world. In these cases, choosing a class may restrict where your character can be from.
		
		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="classPages/classes/SpecialistPage.html">Specialist</a> </b>
		<br> A true survivalist who eschews magic for the skills she has learned with her own two hands. There are several different paths for Specialists to follow, but that is a decision for them to make after they have gained some substantial experience. Whether they are beastmasters, trappers, herbalists, or tacticians, specialists are the highly trained operatives that focus on getting the job done.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="classPages/classes/RuneKnight.html">Rune Knight</a> </b>
		<br> Hailing from Enthan, the Rune Knights are the epitome of those who seek to protect the average citizen. In Enthan, arcane magic is looked upon with suspicion. The common people do not understand it, but it has the capacity to harm and enslave many. In order to combat its pervasive power, the Rune Knights arose. These veteran warriors are heavy armored juggernauts who spent enough time studying magic to know how it works- and more importantly, how to kill it. 

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="classPages/classes/ManaBoundPage.html">ManaBound</a> </b>
		<br> Among the Tri-Villages of Taria there sits a town known as Werta. Here, the most focused martial artists practice a special kind of elemental mastery in the form of Mana. With the cionstantly renewing power of Mana on their side, the combative ManaBound cut all connnection to other magics in exchange for a regenerating supply of power that lets them fling elemental destruction right along with their carefully trained unarmed blows.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="classes/WildDancerPage.html">Wild Dancer</a> </b>
		<br> All around TWE, people have learned to meld their cultural arts with the deadly and alluring dance of nature, harnessing its power through grace, its magic through unity, and are stepping into battle with their bestial dance partners.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="classes/ArcaneWellspringPage.html">Arcane Wellspring</a> </b>
		<br> Casting aside the time-sensitive battle-casting mindset of their posh past, the Arcane Wellspring arose as a class of wizards who twist spell into ritual. These beacons of hope spread their magic over their allies like a safety blanket, ensuring that as long as they still stand, their communities will not fall to outsiders.

		<br><br><b class="subheader"> <a href="classes/FluxcasterPage.html">Fluxcaster</a> </b>
		<br> Far in the east, where magic has taken a whole new meaning, there exists a new breed of magician who redefines the term “caster.” These people are weak in body but strong in spirit. They carry within themselves reservoirs of this strange foreign power called flux. Fluxcasters eschew physical fitness and fortitude, tying their minds and spirits to flux in order to wield its power by calling forth flux into the physical world. Every fluxcaster is unique, wielding the diverse power of flux as a reflection of their own minds and personalities.
