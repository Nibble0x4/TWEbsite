	<br> This is a page dedicated to explaining the process of training and teaching in Downtime! 

	<br><br> This is a way to get something out of Downtime. I hope you use it to inspire fun roleplay! ~ Nibble

	<hr>

	<p class="body-text">
		Training and Teaching are mechanics that allow players to use Downtime to grow stronger, gaining skills, feats, spells, and even ability scores by interacting with each other during otherwise dull times in an adventure.


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> First Step </b>
		<br> Before you train, you have to figure out what you are training for!
		<ul>
			<li>You can increase one of your ability scores by +1 at the cost of another.  </li>
			<li>You can gain a feat that they qualify for. (As long as the GM approves the feat) </li>
			<li>You can practice with a specific weapon until you become proficient with it. </li>
		</ul>

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Second Step </b>
		<br> Once the GM has approved the goal of your training, it is time to figure out how much work you need to put in!
		<br><br> Every goal is tracked in Milestones. The more difficult the goal, the more Milestones it will require.
		<br><br> Below is a list of formulas that should make it easy to figure out the Milestones needed during training.
		<ul>
			<li><b>Ability Score</b> - Pick a rising stat and a falling stat. The modifiers of these are (rsmod) and (fsmod). On completion, you gain +1/-1 in your rising/falling stats.
				<br> <b style="color:brown">Milestones = 3 + rsmod - fsmod.</b>  </li>
			<li><b>Feat</b> - Pick a feat for which you qualify (subject to GM approval). On completion, you gain the feat as a bonus feat.
				<br> <b style="color:brown">Milestones = 3 + 1 per prerequisite the feat has.</b>  </li>
			<li><b>Weapon Proficiency</b> - Pick a weapon you have on hand and can use for training. On completion, you are able to wield the weapon without penalties.
				<br> <b style="color:brown">Milestones = 3.</b>  </li>
		</ul>

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Third Step </b>
		<br> Now that you know how many Milestones you must attain, you are ready to start training!
		<br><br> You may train by spending 1 hour of uninterrupted time working on your goal. Feel free to describe how you are doing it! 
		<br> For each hour that you spend, you may roll 1d20 and add a value to the result (Ask the GM). Add this to a running total and tell the GM when it is 100 or higher!
		<br><br> When your running total is greater than 100, reduce it back to 0 and gain a Milestone for your training! 
		<br><br> When you have acquired all the Milestones you need, you gain your reward!
		<br><br><b> Note: </b> Training is quite intensive, so you can only do it for 2 hours a day and you cannot do it while fatigued or while sore.
		<br> If you train any longer than that in a day, then you become fatigued the next morning.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Soreness </b>
		<br> Each time you acquire a Milestone, you become Sore for a day. You will need to wait for the soreness to pass and get a change of scenery before you will be ready for another Milestone!
		<br><br> While Sore, you cannot train. In addition, if you are sore from increasing an Ability Score, then you will suffer a -2 penalty to that score until the soreness ends. Be careful!

	<p class="body-text"> <b class="header"> Teaching! </b>
	<br> Some characters may have taken the Instructor feat. If they have, then they can spend Downtime teaching others!

	<p class="body-text">
		Teaching works very similarly to training, with only a few diffferences listed below!


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Different Options </b>
		<br> There are more things you can teach than you can train on your own!
		<ul>
			<li>You can increase one of the ability scores of your student, provided it is smaller than your own.  </li>
			<li>You can teach the student until they acquire a feat that the student qualifies for and that you possess.</li>
			<li>You can instruct a student until they become proficient with a weapon that you are proficient with. </li>
			<li>You can provide training in a skill that the student is not trained in, as long as you are. </li>
			<li>You can share a spell with a caster of your same type (arcane, divine, primal, occult). </li>
			<li>You can teach someone who isn't a caster of your same type to cast a single 0 or 1st level spell that you know. </li>
		</ul>

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Milestones </b>
		<br> Milestones work the same way, but with different formulas!
		<ul>
			<li><b>Ability Score</b> - Pick a stat to teach. The teacher's stat mod(tsmod) and the student's stat mod(ssmod) are taken into account. On completion, the student gains +1 in their stat.
				<br> <b style="color:brown"> 6 + ssmod - tsmod</b>  </li>
			<li><b>Feat</b> - Pick a feat the teacher possesses that the student qualifies for. Subject to GM approval. On completion, the student gains the feat as a bonus feat.
				<br> <b style="color:brown">Milestones = 3</b>  </li>
			<li><b>Weapon Proficiency</b> - Pick a weapon the teacher possesses and is proficient with. On completion, the student is able to wield the weapon without penalties.
				<br> <b style="color:brown">Milestones = 2 - 1 if the teacher possesses a feat for the weapon specifically.</b>  </li>
			<li><b>Skill</b> - Pick a skill that the teacher has and has a higher total than the student in. On completion, the student becomes trained in that skill.
				<br> <b style="color:brown">Milestones = 4 - 1 for every 5 the teacher has as their total for the skill (Min 1).</b>  </li>
			<li><b>Spell to a same type caster</b> - Pick a spell you know that the student does not, subject to GM approval. On completion, the student learns the spell as if it were on their list. (Max 1 spell of each tier)
				<br> <b style="color:brown">Milestones = 1 + tier of the spell</b>  </li>
			<li><b>Spell to other</b> - Pick a 0 or 1 tier spell you know, subject to GM approval. On completion, the student can cast the spell a number of times per day equal to their modifier in your casting stat. (A student can only know 1 spell in this way per mental stat)
				<br> <b style="color:brown">Milestones = 4 + tier of the spell</b>  </li>
		</ul>

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Sessions </b>
		<br> The process for each teaching session works identically to training, but the Teacher rolls instead of the student. 

		<br><br><b> Note: </b> You can only train 1 student at a time, no group classes! It requires 1 on 1 work!

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Soreness </b>
		<br> When you are teaching, you do not get sore!
		<br><br> Instead, your student is sore in the same way as if they had trained themselves.
