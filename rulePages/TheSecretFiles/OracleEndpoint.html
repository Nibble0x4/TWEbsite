	Hi <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">Goob!</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	Congratulations on making it all the way here!
	<br>
	I apologize if it was aggravating, but I thought this would be a fun way to ask a question that means a lot to me.
	<br>
	<br>
	You've been a <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">truly</b> wonderful friend to me, Goob, and have been that way ever since we were just two stupid kids learning to swim.
	<br> 
	You've been a friend to talk to about fun things, sure, but you have always been there for more important things too. I haven't always used you properly and I am still trying to grow there, but I am thankful for your constant friendship and support. <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">It means more to me than you know</b>.
	<br>
	<br>
	So with that said, I would like to ask if you would stand with me on what might very well be the biggest day of my life. 
	<br>
	<br>
	I would be <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">honored</b> to have you as my groomsman during my wedding, if you are willing.
	<br> 
	<br>
	There are no more puzzles or other silly run-around gags now. I got all of that out of my system. Let me know your answer, I am eagerly awaiting it. I don't know exactly when you are reading this, but I hope you are having a wonderful day! 
	<br>
	<br>
	Talk to you later, Oracle!
	<br> ~ <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">Nibble</b>
