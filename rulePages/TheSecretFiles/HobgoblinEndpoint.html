	Hi <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">Cmrn!</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	Congratulations on making it all the way here!
	<br>
	I apologize if it was aggravating, but I thought this would be a fun way to ask a question that means a lot to me.
	<br>
	<br>
	You've been my closest friend for pretty much my entire life. I am not great at showing it, I think, but your friendship means so much to me that I am really not sure how to express it. 
	<br> 
	We have enjoyed talking about real and imaginary things ever since we were small, and the knowledge that I have a friend that I can talk to about anything at any time is <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">truly</b> something I am <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">privileged</b> to have. Thank you for being there for me each and every time in every season of my life. 
	<br>
	<br>
	So with that said, I would like to ask if you would stand with me on what might very well be the biggest day of my life. It would just simply feel <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">wrong</b> otherwise. 
	<br>
	<br>
	I would be <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">so happy</b> to have you as my groomsman during my wedding, if you are willing.
	<br> 
	<br>
	There are no more puzzles or other silly run-around gags now. I got all of that out of my system. Let me know your answer, I am eagerly awaiting it. I don't know exactly when you are reading this, but I hope you are having a wonderful day! 
	<br>
	<br>
	See you soon, Hobgoblin!
	<br> ~ <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">Nibble</b>
