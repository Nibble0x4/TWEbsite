	Hi <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">Jerm!</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	Congratulations on making it all the way here!
	<br>
	I apologize if it was aggravating, but I thought this would be a fun way to ask a question that means a lot to me.
	<br>
	<br>
	We don't talk about this sort of thing much, never really have, but I want to say a bit about how important you are to me as a brother. 
	<br> 
	We have never been confidants, really, and I <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">regret</b> that. I am not sure it is in either of us to talk much about how we feel or other such important things, but I am so <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">incredibly</b> grateful for the role you've played in my life. I have always watched you, as younger brothers tend to do, and tried to learn. 
	<br>
	I have <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">wonderful</b> memories of childhood, very different from those of most younger brothers I meet. I am so much better off for having you as a brother. Thank you for making time to help me, talk about cool and interesting things with me, and teach me things I would never have learned otherwise.
	<br>
	<br>
	So with that said, I would like to ask if you would stand with me on what might very well be the biggest day of my life. I can't imagine picking anyone else for this role. The support you showed when I told you of my plans to propose to Abigail will <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">never</b> be forgotten. It meant the world to me when my mind was such a roiling mess of fear and confusion I could hardly think straight.
	<br>
	<br>
	I would be <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">grateful</b> to have you as my <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">best man</b> during my wedding, if you are willing.
	<br> 
	<br>
	There are no more puzzles or other silly run-around gags now. I got all of that out of my system. Let me know your answer, I am eagerly awaiting it. I don't know exactly when you are reading this, but I hope you are having a wonderful day! 
	<br>
	<br>
	Thanks for reading, Wyrm!
	<br> ~ <b style="color: royalblue; background: black;">Nibble</b>
