	<br> This is a page dedicated to explaining the basics of spell creation! 

	<br><br> This is among my favorite abilities that casters can get, so I hope this page is helpful for you! ~ Nibble

		Spell creation is a very loose rule that exists in TWE, to be managed and controlled by the GM. It allows potentially any caster, but traditionally just Intelligence-based arcane casters, the ability to conceive their very own spells and see them realized in the world of TWE!

		<br><br> How exactly it works depends on the situation, but the usual way it works follows these steps:


		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> First Step </b>
		<br> When a would-be spell crafter wishes to begin work on their first spell, they must first decide on <b>the effects of the spell they wish to create</b>. 
		<br><br> This is, ironically, the most difficult and complicated part of the spell creation process. Thankfully, it isn't up to the player alone!
		<br><br> For most players, thinking up the mechanical effects of a spell is too overwhelming at first. Instead, it is best to think about the <b> idea of the spell</b>.
		<br> This is the fun part of the spell. What kind of spell is it? Does it deal damage? Summon something? Provide a buff? Does the spell have an intriguing tradeoff or large cost? Is it an elemental spell? Is it a signature spell, reflective of the power or personality or experiences of the caster who created it?
		<br><br> Once these questions are answered and the idea of the spell is made, then it is time to move to the next step.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Second Step </b>
		<br> The next step is a lot easier for the crafter. They should now give their spell idea to their GM. The GM will help the player, talking through the spell idea and working to make it a reality in the mechanics of the game.  
		<br><br> Once the spell is ironed out, then the GM will assign it the usual details of a spell: Casting Time, Duration, Spell School, Components, and most importantly, <b>Tier</b>.
		<br><br> The Tier of the spell determines what it takes for the spell to be created and, while a caster can technically create a spell of any level, they won't be able to cast the spell until they are high enough level in a class that lets them cast arcane spells.

		<br><br><hr><p class="body-text"><br><b class="classFeatureHeader"> Final Step </b>
		<br> Finally, it is time to craft! The process of actually crafting the spell in-game is essentially just the process of the creator's character spending hours of work in-game. 
		<br><br> As the GM sees fit, the player may spend time in working sessions. For each such session, the player makes a single Spellcraft skill check. The result of this check is added to a running tally that builds up each time the character has a chance to work on the spell. 
		<br> <b><u>NOTE: </u></b> If the roll on the check is a <b>natural 1</b>, then the session is wasted and no progress is made. If the roll is a <b>natural 20</b>, then the results of the check are simply doubled before being added to the tally.
		<br><br> Below is a table with ROUGH ESTIMATED values for how large the tallies would need to become in order to complete a spell of a given tier. <b>These numbers are tentative, and are merely guidelines.</b>
